gsForeword The Roads and Maritime Services (RMS) and 
the Bureau of Transport Statistics (BTS) 
commissioned Sinclair Knight Merz to undertake
 the Sydney Cycling Survey 2011. The main 
objective of this survey was to measure performance against the 
NSW 2021 target to more than 
double the mode share of cycling among trips up to
 10 km in the Sydney Greater Metropolitan 
Area by 2016. The survey also collected data suit
able for the analysis of the incidence and nature 
of cycling, the characteristics of 
cyclists and cycling participation. 
This report documents the survey methodology 
and estimation process, and presents the main 
findings. This report was prepared 
by SKM for the RMS and the BTS.

Sydney Cycling Survey 2011: Methods and Findin
gs4Executive Summary The NSW 2021 
strategic business plan establishes a target to more than double the mode share 
of cycling among trips up to 10 km in the Sydney 
Greater Metropolitan Area by 2016.  In order to 
achieve this target, Roads and Maritime Servic
es (RMS) and the Bureau of Transport Statistics 
(BTS) commissioned Sinclair Knight Merz to develop a survey method to monitor performance 
towards this target.  This survey was first 
undertaken in November 2010 and was referred to as 
the Sydney Cycling Survey (SCS) 2010.   
The Sydney Cycling Survey 2011 was conducted us
ing computer assisted telephone interviews 
of a stratified sample of households in the Greater Metropolitan Area from 14 November to 4 

December 2011.  A total of 11,281 individuals from
 4,153 households were interviewed.  Data on 
individual and household demographics was obtained, as well as information on cycling 

participation.  The 321 individuals who had cycled on 
the previous day were asked about the trips 
they had made by bicycle over that period.  These interviews provided a total of 658 cycling trip 
observations (of which 574 were 10
 km or less in length).   
Population statistics were estimated using we
ights derived from the ABS estimated resident 
population for 2010.  The BTS Household Travel Survey was used to provide an indication of 
travel by all modes along with the results of 
this survey to estimate a cycling mode share. 
The key findings were as follows: 
 18.0% (CI
1: 17.2%-18.8%) of the populati
on cycled at least once in the previous week (2010: 
11.9%) and 26.2% (CI: 25.3%-27.1%) cycled at 
least once in the previous month (2010: 
22.2%). 
 Males are far more likely to have ridden than fe
males; 24% of males rode in the previous week 
compared with 13% of females. 
 Children are far more likely to have ridden recently than adults; 58% of children aged under 10 
had ridden in the past week, compared with 15% 
of those aged 30 Œ 49 and 6% of those aged 
over 50. 
 Our best estimate is that on a typical 
day around 180,000 residents of the Sydney Greater 
Metropolitan Area ride a bicycle in a public ar
ea, making a total of around 369,000 cycling trip 
legs (of any length).  Around 60% of these trips ar
e for social, exercise or recreation purposes.  
Around 157,000 residents make cycling trips in 
public areas that are 10 km or shorter, 
equating to a total of around 327,000 trip legs per day
2.  The cycling mode share estimate for trips of 10 km or less is 2.17% (CI: 1.87%-2.47%), a 
statistically insignificant difference over 2010 (1
.91%).  There is considerable variation across 
gender and age groups; females aged 50 or over have the lowest cycling mode share (0.21%) 
and males aged under 15 have the high
est cycling mode share (7.67%). 
1 95% confidence interval. 
2 Most individuals make two trips per day, or one round trip.  Where a round trip is made it is divided into two trips, each of 
half the duration; this is consistent with the way in 
which round trips are handled in 
the Household Travel Survey.

gs51 Introduction Sinclair Knight Merz (SKM) was commissioned by the NSW Roads and Maritime Services (RMS) 
and the Bureau of Transport Statistics (BTS) 
to develop and field a survey to monitor 
performance towards the 
NSW 2021
 strategic business plan target: 
More than double the mode share of bicycle tr
ips made in the Greater Sydney region, at a 
local and district level, by 2016. 
(NSW 2021, p20) 
Local trips were defined in the plan as trips of 5 km or less, while district trips were trips up to and 

including 10 km.  The objective of this study was 
to design and field a survey instrument to allow 
monitoring of this target on an annual basis. 
1.1 Defining the target In designing the survey methodology, the definition of the 
NSW 2021 
target has been specified as 
follows: 
 the proportion
 of bicycle trips, compared to walking,
 using a car or travelling by bus, rail, 
ferry and other modes that are equal to or under 10 km in length, 
 ﬁGreater Sydneyﬂ: residents 
of the Sydney and Illawarra St
atistical Divisions and the 
Newcastle Statistical Subdivision (referred 
to here as the Sydney Greater Metropolitan 
Area (GMA), 
 unlinked trips (also referred to as trip stages or 
stops): trips broken down into stages 
where a change of mode is involved (e.g. a bicycle ride to a station, followed by a train 
trip and walk at the other end would be three unlinked trips), are more than 100 m in 
length and include changes of modes involvi
ng the same vehicle type (e.g. a walk from 
one train to another at one station) Œ these ar
e hereafter simply referred to as ﬁtripsﬂ, 
 all purposes of travel, 
 persons of all ages are in scope
3,  trips made by residents by bicycle that star
t and/or finish in the Greater Sydney area are 
included, 
 the target is set for the 2016 financial year (i.e. 2016/17), 
 only trips which are 
10 km or under
 in length are included, and 
 average of all days in the week including weekend days. 
Most importantly, the target is to achieve a 
mode share
 Œ and this requires an understanding of 
travel by all modes for trips of up to 10 km in length, not only cycling trips.  The principle adopted 
in the present study was to use the best avail
able survey data; the Household Travel Survey 
provides information on overall (all-mode, all-purp
ose) travel by residents of the study area, as 
                                                                 
 3 This has implications for the survey
 methodology, as Australian Market Re
search Association guidelines prevent 
telephone interviewing of persons under 15 years of age. 
Sydney Cycling Survey 2011: Methods and Findin
gs6this dataset represents our best understanding of overall travel in Sydney while the dedicated 
cycling survey provides dat
a on cycling travel only. 
1.2 Limitations of existing datasets 
Existing datasets on travel in the Sydney GMA ar
e insufficient to allow reliable monitoring of 
cycling mode share.  The three main data source
s available on travel in Sydney, and cycling in 
particular, are summarised in Table 1.1.  The limit
ations identified here are most importantly the 
insufficient sample sizes for cycling travel in 
the Household Travel Survey (HTS), limited purpose 
in the ABS census (commuting only) and limited spre
ad of permanent bicycle counters mean that 
a dedicated primary survey effort is required.

gs72Survey design 2.1 Overview 
The survey methodology is predicated on two principles: 
1. The methodology should produce 
unbiased
 estimates which are 
sufficiently reliable
 to predict annual changes in a mode (cycling) which has a very small base mode share. 
2. The methodology must be 
cost effective
 (or more correctly, must produce a sufficiently 
reliable estimate at minimum cost). 
The method that has been adopted is as follows: 
 a cross-sectional
4 computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) survey, 
 speak to any person in the household aged 18 or older who is available for interview, 
 ask that person to provide 
basic demographic characteristics of all members of their 
household and when those individuals last rode a bicycle, 
 ask all household members who have ridden ye
sterday (defined as midnight to midnight) 
for the details of their cycling trips Œ a
llow proxy reporting where another household 
member is unavailable,  
 expand the cycling survey data to population es
timates using benchmarks consistent with 
the 2010/11 HTS (derived from ABS estimated resident population estimates), 
 determine all-mode trip rates for trips under 10 km from the HTS (2010/11
5),  estimate the 2011 cycling mode share for trips under 10 km. 
We describe the design of the 2011 survey in more detail in the following sections.  There were a 
number of changes since the 2010 survey whic
h are pertinent when comparisons are made 
between the years.  These changes are summarised in Table 2.1. 
4 A cross-sectional survey is a survey that interviews indivi
duals (or, in this case, households) at one point in time.  Ideally
, one would repeat the survey with the 
same individuals/households over
 time to explore their changes in behaviour.  Such 
a survey is a longitudinal survey, but
 for various reasons would be prohibi
tively expensive for this activity. 
5 Trips for all modes are based on un
linked trips except for walking.

Computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) wa
s chosen as the most co
st effective survey 
method, offering the best opportunity to obtain ti
mely data and having the greatest control over 
sampling biases.  The survey was conducted over a three week period from 14 November to 3 
December 2011.  The telephone interviews were conducted by Market Solutions on behalf of the 
project team.  All interviewers were experienced in conducting telephone interviews and had been 
subject to training on the survey objectives prior to commencing fieldwork.  The following quality 
assurance activities were undertaken specific to this project: 
 all interviewers were given a training session
6 before working on the project, 
 interviewers were provided with a survey m
anual to help them clarify complicated situations 
that may arise during interviews, 
 one or several supervisors were present during in
terviews to answer questions of clarification 
from interviewers and to listen in
 to interviews in real-time, 
 nightly summary statistics were provided to the research team to confirm the survey was 
proceeding as expected, and 
 five attempts at recontacting non-responding telephone numbers were made and each was 
undertaken at different times of day and days of we
ek (in order to minimise the likelihood of 
contact loss and non-response bias). 
2.3 Sampling frame A sampling frame is a database from which t
he sample is selected.  The frame was a 
commercially available database of landline tel
ephone numbers (both listed and unlisted) for the 
study area.  Such a database excludes hou
seholds that do not own a landline telephone
7, or those who have only obtained a landline recently (the
 database is updated in waves, but is fairly 
                                                                 
 6 This training covered topics such as the purpose and obj
ectives of the survey, the meaning of specific terms and 
questions and example cases to help interviewe
rs classify difficult travel patterns. 
7 The Australian Communications and Median Authority (ACMA (2011) 
Convergence and Communications: Australian 
household consumers™ take-up and use 
of voice communications services
) estimates that 88% of Australian households 
have a landline telephone. 
9Sydney Cycling Survey 2011: Methods and Findin
gs10representative for 2009).  This latter issue may limit the sample in areas where significant 
residential construction has occurred in recent times. 
2.4 Sampling unit The sampling unit for the survey was 
households
.  Within each household one person aged 18 
or over was asked to report on the characteri
stics of their household 
and the persons usually 
resident within that household.   
2.5 Sampling strata In sample surveys the statisti
cal uncertainty can be reduced by 
stratifying
 the sample.  
Stratification is the process of dividing a populat
ion into non-overlapping, homogenous groups of 
households or individuals and then specifying the number of samples to be obtained within each 
group.  In this survey the number of samples 
were specified based on st
atistical subdivisions (SSDs), of which there are 17 in the study area. 
The sampling frame consisted of telephone numbers referenced to a postcode.  For each SSD 
postcode correspondences were prepared.  These correspondences were, for some postcodes, 
approximate as some postcodes cross SSD boundar
ies.  Where this was the case a manual 
assessment was made to allocate the postcode to
 one SSD only by assessing the most likely 

location of the population resident within that 
postcode.  In almost all cases where postcodes 
significantly overlapped two SSDs the postcode 
was in a predominantly rural area, with one 
township.  In such cases the postcode would be allocated to the SSD in which that township 
resides. 
Each SSD varied significantly in population and the number of dwellings.  A target of maintaining 
approximately constant sampling fractions across
 the SSDs was set, using household projections 
for 2010 provided by BTS
8.  In order to achieve these target
s the survey team was required to 
achieve a spread of interviews approximately consistent with the proportion of households within 
each SSD.  This spread was to be maintained in aggregate across all survey days and, as best 
could be achieved, on each survey session.  In
 this way a situation was avoided where, for 
example, the interviewers focussed on particul
ar geographic areas during each survey session. 
8 Projections for 2010 were the most rec
ently available, and in any case are used as the expansion targets in the HTS 
2010/11 with which the SCS data will be compared.  As 
such, a consistent set of expansions are used.

2.6 Qualifiers Qualifiers are screener questions used to identif
y respondents who are in scope for a survey.  As 
we are interested in travel by all residents of 
the Sydney GMA the only qualifiers are of a practical 
nature: 
1) only respondents who are conversant in the English language were interviewed, 
2) respondents households must be lo
cated within the Sydney GMA, and 
3) respondents must be aged 18 or over. 

Given these qualifiers, the vast majority of 
households would qualify for the survey.   
11Sydney Cycling Survey 2011: Methods and Findin
gs122.7 Survey instrument The survey instrument is provided as Appendix A. 
 The instrument consistent of the following 
sections: 
 identify an individual in the household who is 
aged 18 or older and speak to that person, 
 screener to ensure respondent is in the correct SSD quota, 
 identify demographic characteristics (gender, 
age, employment status) of that primary 
individual, 
 identify household characteristics (vehicle and 
bicycle ownership, number of residents), 
 identify demographic characteristics 
(gender, age, employment status) of 
all other household 
members, 
 identify all household members who rode a bicycle 
yesterday
 (defined as midnight to 
midnight), 
 interview the selected individuals to identify their cycling travel yesterday 
o if under 15, ask a proxy to report travel on their behalf 
o if not currently home (or unavailable), ask for another household member who is 
available to respond on their behalf. 
A flowchart illustrating the interview structure is given in Figure 2.1.

2.7.1Cycling trip recall 
The cycling trip recall activity was intended to 
determine the number of trips made by bicycle, and 
the purpose for which these trips were made.  Best practice in travel diary research recommends 
that respondents be identified 
prior to travel occurring, such that respondents can be asked to 
record all travel as it occurs.  This recommendation is based on experience that suggests that 
trips are under-reported in recall and that respond
ents report what they usually do, rather than 
actually did over the period in question.  Howeve
r, constraints on the survey budget meant that 
13Sydney Cycling Survey 2011: Methods and Findin
gs14one day trip recall was the only practical means of 
conducting the survey.  Two strategies were 
adopted in the survey design and implementation to attempt to redress these issues regarding 
recall:  respondents were asked to think only about their 
cycling travel, not travel by all modes, and 
 a place-based approach was taken, where res
pondents were asked to identify where they 
started and finished a trip ; this also provides a means by which to classify trip purposes. 
While not the most optimum method to maximise trip enumeration, analysis of the survey 
responses indicated plausible responses and cycling tr
ip rates.  However, it is still possible that 
the number of cycling trips was underestimated by
 respondents to some extent, and this will have 
the effect of underestimating the 
overall cycling mode share.   
2.8 Survey fieldwork The survey was undertaken over a 21 day period from Monday 14 November to Saturday 3 
December 2011.  Calls were made during the eveni
ng (5 pm Œ 8 pm), except where a household 
was un-contactable during these times, in which 
case other times of day and days of week were 
attempted.  The results presented in the followi
ng sections are based entirely on the results of 
this main fieldwork phase.

checks, and the resolution, are summarised in Ta
ble 3.2.  The most significant change was to 
split trips that started and finished in the same pl
ace into two trips Œ each of half the reported trip 
distance.  For example, a significant number of 
trips were reported as starting and finishing at 
home Œ these are recoded as two recreation trips.  Th
is process is consistent with that used in the 
HTS. 16Sydney Cycling Survey 2011: Methods and Findin

 4,153 households containing 11,281 individuals 
 1,632 individuals (15.1%) had ridden in the past 
week, of which 321 (2.8% of all individuals) 
had ridden a bicycle yesterday in a public place 
(a further 115 (1.0%) had ridden only in the 
backyard, giving a total of 3.8% who had ridden in the previous day). 
 Of these 321 individuals making bicycle trip
s yesterday, 105 (33%) were interviewed for the 
cycling travel recall activity.  A further 208 
individuals (66%) were interviewed by proxy, and 
the remaining eight were unavailable for interview and no other household member was 
available to report on their behalf. 
 There were a total of 658 recorded bicycle trip
s made on the previous day, or an average of 
2.0 bicycle trip legs per cycling individual. 
 Of these 658 trips, 574 (87%) were 10 km or less
 in length (across 276 individuals).  It is these 
trips that were retained in order to determine 
a cycling trip rate (and
 cycling mode share). 
3.4 Day-of-week sampling 
In order to obtain as representative a sample 
as possible the fieldwork was spread out over 
several weeks, with the intention of obtaining 
approximately the same completions on any one 
evening.  The total number of interviews, and the weather conditions on the 
previous
 day are given in Table 3.3.

3.5 Demographic characteristics 
In the weighting process discussed in Section 3.6 the sample is divided into four age bands (0 Œ 
9, 10 -29, 30 Œ 49 and 50+) and the two gender ca
tegories across each of the 17 statistical 
subdivisions.  An indication of the level of 
over- and under-representati
on of each of these age 
and gender categories is provided in Figure 3.2.  In comparison to the HTS targets (which 

represent our best estimate of the population distribution) the sample has too few people aged 
under 50.  These demographic skews are common wi
th telephone survey research.  Inferences 
about the population from this demographically skewed data would not be appropriate; instead it 

is necessary to weight the data 
to better represent the population.

3.6 Weighting and expansion In a manner consistent with the HTS, targets fo
r estimated residential population (ERP) produced 
by the ABS for 2010 adjusted for those living in private dwellings only were used to expand the 
sample.  These benchmarks were provided at the 
household and person level.  As the age bands 
in the SCS differed somewhat from those used in
 the HTS expansion process it was necessary to 
aggregate the ERP person targets and apply a correction factor (0.9628 on all cells) as used in 
the BTS process.  The targets were based on three variables: 
 At the 
household level:  o statistical subdivision (17) 
 At the 
person level: o Statistical subdivision (17) 
o Gender 
o Age band (0 Œ 9, 10 Œ 29, 30 Œ 49, 50+). 
The result was weighting and expansion targets co
nsisting of 17 targets at the household level 
and 136 at the person level.   
The distribution of the households across the GM
A accorded almost precisely with the target 
sampling fractions, as shown in Figure 3.3.  This
 is as would be expected, given the stratification 
used in the sampling.  The number of households in each statistical subdivision in the sample is 
shown in Table 3.5; the subdivision with the l
east households was Illawarra (115) and the most 
was Newcastle (427).

The smallest cell at the person level contained 4 
observations (Illawarra SD males 0-9) and the 
largest 292 observations (Newcastle females 50+), wi
th a median of 75 observations for all cells.   
Checks were performed on descriptive statistics with and without weighting, and with and without 
the weight truncation, to check the sensitivity of t
he descriptive statistics to the weighting process.  
These tests, not reported here, f
ound generally minor changes to variables of interest.  More 
substantial changes were observed with some vari
ables Œ such as cycling participation, which 
increased from 15.1% to 18.0% after weighti
ng.  These changes are plausible, and may be 
explained by the over-representati
on of a group with a lower cycling participation (namely, those 
aged over 50). 
Sydney Cycling Survey 2011: Methods and Findin
gs233.7 Confidence intervals Any population statistic that is based on a sample of the population will be subject to statistical 
uncertainty that is attributable entirely to 
the (nominally) random sampling of the population
10.  This uncertainty can be represented by confidence
 intervals, which are bounds within which we 
can have a specified level of confidence that t
he true value most likely falls.  The exact analytical methods first described by Kish
11 are used to determine the confidence intervals for the weighted 
data. 3.8 Weather and seasonal variation Cycling, particularly for non-utilitarian travel such as recreation and sport, will vary depending on 
the weather.  Data from permanent bicycle coun
ters, as well as manual observations, suggest 
that commuter cycling drops by around 30% in wi
nter months in temperate climates such as 
Sydney, while recreational cycling can drop by
 50% or more depending on the weather.   
The present survey was conduct
ed over a two week period in November and early December, 
when weather conditions are typically
 not too different to the annual average (Table 3.6).  
However, in 2011 higher than average rainfall was experienced over the period; it rained on 11 of 

the 20 survey days (55%) compared with 100 days 
per annum on average (27%).  As such, we 

would expect the cycling participation ra
te and cycling mode share estimates to be 
under-
estimates in comparison to the annual average.

almost always handled only in qualitative terms, and 
often their magnitude can only be speculated upon.

4.1 Cycling participation 
Of the 11,281 individuals in the sample the cycling participation information was obtained for 
10,797 (95.7%) individuals.  Based on the weighted
 records, we estimate that 18.0% (CI: 17.2%-
18.8%) of the population had ridden sometime in the past week and 26.2% (CI: 25.3%-27.1%) 

within the past month (Figure 4.1).  These proportions are significantly higher than measured in 
2010; the proportion who indicated they had ridden in the past week was 11.9% (CI: 11.1% - 
12.8%).    Figure 4.1: When did you last ride a bicycle?

As shown in Figure 4.2, 24% of males and 13% of
 females rode over the previous week.  This 
increases to 33% of males and 19% of females ov

gs4.2Cycling trips Of the sample of 10,797 individuals for whom riding information was available 321 (2.8%) had 
ridden on the previous day on a public thoroughfare (an additional 115 had ridden only in their 
backyard or other private property).  These 321 i
ndividuals made a total of 658 bicycle trip legs 
(2.0 trips/person/day for those who had ridden).
  Once the sample was weighted the best 
population estimate is that 180,000 GMA resident
s ride in a public area on a typical day, making 
around 369,000 cycling trip legs per day (of any distance).   
Only those trips under 10 km and made at least partly on public land (e.g. footpaths, roads or in 
parks) are of relevance to the NSW 2021 monitori
ng.  In the survey there were 276 individuals 
who made 574 trips under 10 km on public land.  Once weighted and expanded this corresponds 

to an estimated 157,000 residents riding on a typi
cal day, making around 327,000 cycling trip legs 
per day.   4.3 Trip purposes The purpose for all cycling trips (including those over 10 km) was determined from the weighted 
survey data.  Both the origin and destination trip purposes are obtained in the survey; the 
following rules were applied to determine a trip purpose: 
1) use the destination trip purpose if the origin purpose is home (and the destination purpose is 
not home), 
2) use the origin trip purpose if the destinati
on is home (and the origin purpose is not home), 
3) where neither the origin or destination is 
home then apply the following purpose hierarchy:  
 shopping 
 personal business 
 social / recreation 
 hospital / medical 
 hotel / motel 
 transport interchange 
 education 
 work 
 other private dwelling 
 other. 
The trip purpose split is shown in Figure 4.4 and 
shows that around 60% of all trips are for social 
or recreation purposes and 13% are for work purposes.

Trip distances were self-repor
ted by respondents.  These will be subject to uncertainty (and 
potentially, bias).  However, as the primary obj
ective of obtaining trip distances were to 
distinguish bicycle trips that were less than or equal to 10 km in length this approach was 

considered to be acceptable.  72% of all cycling trip stages were less than 5 km in length and 

92% are under 10 km (Figure 4.5).

estimate is 0.061 trips/person/day (CI: 0.053-0.070).
  Males make around 2.5 times the number of 
cycling trips as females, and those aged under 10 make 2.5 times more cycling trips than those 
aged 10 Œ 29.

4.5 Cycling mode share The principle objective of this study was to identify the cycling mode share for trips less than or 
equal to 10 km in length.  In order to convert the cycling trip rates in Section 4.4.1 into trip mode 
shares, all-mode, all-purpose trip rates were obt
ained from 2010/11 HTS for those trips that were 
less than or equal to 10 km in length.  These trip
 rates were provided by the Bureau of Transport 
Statistics and were segmented into gender and 
three age bands (0-9, 10-29, 30-49, 50+).  These 
trip rates, on an average day, are presented in T
able 4.3.  The confidence interval is presented 
for the total trip rate based on a 99% confidence interval assuming a simple random sample.

The 2010/11 HTS estimate for trip rates (under 
10 km) across all segments is 2.813/person/day.  
The cycling trip rates in Table 4.2 were then divided into the all-mode trip rates in Table 4.3 in 
order to provide estimates of mode shares.

The implied cycling mode share across the population is 2.17% (CI: 1.87%-2.47%
).  By 
comparison, the HTS cycling mode share estimate is 0.85% (CI: 0.70%-1.00%)
13.  These shares 
are compared graphically in Figure 4.6.  The SCS mode share estimates in both 2010 and 2011 
are more than twice those of HTS.  However, 
the confidence intervals are also wider in the 
present survey (as would be expected given the 
much smaller sample size).  There is no 
statistically significant difference in the cycli
ng mode share estimates between the two years of 
the SCS (2010 and 2011). 
1212 The standard error of the ratio of cycling trips to all-m
ode trips (i.e. cycling mode share) was determined using the Delta 
method: 
It is assumed that both samples are independent; that is, there 
is no covariance between the cycling trip rate and all-mode 
trip rate. 
13 By way of comparison the HTS 2009/10 reports a cycling mode share for trips under 10 km of 0.92%.

4.6 Proxy reporting Of the 321 individuals who rode on the previous day, 33% reported their cycling travel directly 
while the remainder reported their travel via proxy.
  Proxy reporting of travel is not recommended 
given the potential for misreporting.  To determine what effect proxy reporting may have on the 
estimates presented in this report the unweig
hted trip rates by demographic segment for the 
direct responses and the proxy responses are compar
ed in Figure 4.7.  The overall trip rates do 

not differ greatly between the samples Œ for directly
 reported travel the average trip rate is 2.10 
trips/day and for proxy reporting is 2.07 trips/day.  There are no significant differences in the trip 
rates for males between direct and proxy report
ing, although there is a tendency for proxy 
reporting by females aged 10 Œ 49 to be around 25% 
lower than the direct reports.  However, the 
number of observations in these categories can be 
low (for example, there 
are eight direct reports 
by females aged 10 to 29 and 16 proxy reports by females aged 30 to 49).  We conclude from 

this analysis that proxy reporting is not 
unduly biasing the estimated cycling travel.

SYDNEY™S CYCLING FUTURE
DECEMBER 2013
2MINISTERS™  MESSAGE 
A safe and connected network of bicycle 
paths is an important part of Sydney™s 
integrated transport system. 
 We want to make bike riding a convenient 
and enjoyable option that bene˚ts 
everyone - by improving access to 
towns and centres, reducing congestion 
and increasing capacity on the public 
transport system.
We are investing $33 million into cycling 
in 2013-14 across NSW. This will build new 
routes, ˚x missing links in the network 
and better integrate bike riding with other 
modes of transport. 
Sydney™s Cycling Future
 outlines how we will improve the bicycle network and make sure that 
the needs of bike riders are built into the planning of new transport and infrastructure projects. 
It is the ˚rst time in our state™s history there have been comprehensive plans for active transport.
The NSW Government is working with the Australian Government, councils and the community 
 to plan, prioritise and deliver better connected cycling infrastructure. 
Bicycle riding is already a popular form of transport: it costs nothing, improves health, 
generates zero carbon emissions and, for shorter journeys, can often be quicker than a car or 
public transport. 
Since 2006, the number of people riding to work has increased by 50 per cent in metropolitan 
Sydney. Continuing to increase this mode share will ease pressure on our transport system.
Customers have told us that they would cycle more if it was made safer for them. We are 
prioritising key initiatives that will have an impact on the customer™s safety and experience 
every time they hop on their bike. 
This year we have also joined forces with the Amy Gillett Foundation to deliver an education 
campaign to help improve the safety of bicycle riders in NSW. Bike riders share the road with 
drivers and each has a duty of care to each other. Our education campaigns will focus not only 
on bike rider behaviour, but on careful driver behaviour. 
Sydney™s Cycling Future
 will coordinate planning and investment in infrastructure and 
initiatives, resulting in a safer and easier bicycle riding experience for the people of Sydney.

3EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Sydney™s Cycling Futur
e presents a new direction 
in the way we plan, prioritise and provide for 
cycling in Sydney. This supports the change 

in culture we are seeing in Sydney with more 

people choosing to ride a bike for transport.
Our focus is on the 70 per cent of NSW 
residents who tell us that they would like to 

ride a bike more for everyday transport Œ and 

would do so if cycling was made a safer and 

more convenient option for them. We will make 

bicycle riding a feasible transport option for 

these customers by:
 investing in separated cycleways and 

providing 
connected 
bicycle networks to 
major centres and transport interchanges; 
 promoting
 better use of our existing 
network; and 
 engaging
 with our partners across 
government, councils, developers and 

bicycle users.
We will focus on solutions that provide 

safe separation from motor vehicles and 

pedestrians wherever possible.
We will prioritise our investment on projects 
that have the greatest potential to get the 

most people to shift their short transport trips 

to a bicycle Œ adding capacity to the transport 

system for those who need to travel further. 
We will prioritise bicycle infrastructure 
investment to ensure the projects that will 

have the biggest impact on encouraging 

more people to ride a bike are completed 

˚rst. Investing in connected bike routes that 

are within ˚ve kilometres of major centres 

and public transport interchanges will help to 

increase bike riding for short trips. 
We will invest in state priority corridors to 
safely link inner Sydney customers to Sydney™s 

CBD from the north, east, south and west.
This includes connections to North Sydney, 

St Leonards and Chatswood; Bondi Junction 

and Randwick; Green Square and the Airport; 

and inner west suburbs. We will also deliver 

state priority corridors within a ˚ve kilometre 

catchment of Parramatta, Penrith, Liverpool 

and Blacktown.
We will work with councils to connect 
networks within ˚ve kilometre catchments of 

Sydney™s other major centres. 
Cycling will be linked to urban growth. The 
needs of people on bikes will be included in 

the planning, design and construction of new 

transport and urban development projects.
A new level of service will be provided for 
customers who ride their bike to public 

transport. The Bike and Ride initiative will 

make it convenient for our customers to ride 

to transport hubs, leave their bikes securely 

locked up and transfer to public transport to 

continue their journey. This will include new 

secure access bicycle facilities at our busiest 

public transport interchanges and improved 

bike racks near entrances to all interchanges. 
We will make it easier for customers to ˚nd 
their way as we continue to work with councils 

to roll out directional signs and markings 

on bike routes. Online information will help 

customers to plan their trip. We will also 
 
make maps of local bike networks available 
 
at interchanges.
Bicycle safety will be improved through a 
coordinated campaign for all road users to 

behave safely and share the road. The NSW 

Government will partner with councils to o˜er 

regular bicycle courses, which build people™s 

con˚dence and safety when riding. 
We will continue to support community events 
that showcase local bicycle networks and routes 

and encourage more people to ride for transport.

SYDNEY™S CYCLING FUTURE
DECEMBER 2013
CYCLING FOR TRANSPORT
The overarching goal of 
Sydney™s Cycling Future
 is to make cycling a safe, convenient and 
enjoyable transport option for short trips.
We want to create more liveable towns and 
centres by helping to reduce the burden 
of congestion on our roads and increasing 
capacity on the transport system. 
Our target is to increase the mode share of 
cycling in the Sydney metropolitan region for 
short trips that can be an easy 20 to 30 minute 
ride. Increasing the number of people riding 
 a bike for transport will have a positive impact 

on travel time for people using other modes 
 of transport. Some bicycle paths on roads in the 

Sydney CBD are already moving more people 
than adjacent lanes in the morning peak.
There are numerous opportunities for growing 
the number of people riding bikes and growing 
the frequency with which people ride. Key 
opportunities include:
 Encouraging customers to cycle for short 
trips on the most constrained parts of the 
transport network to free up capacity for 
people who need to travel further
 Integrating bike riding into the way 

communities are designed to make cycling 
journeys safer and more connected
 Improving bicycle access to public transport 
to encourage cycling as part of longer 
transport journeys
 Working in partnership with councils
 Delivering local initiatives that make the 
greatest improvements to safety and 
 local access
 Working in partnership with business 
to develop travel plans to encourage 
employees to ride to work or part of 
 the way
 Capitalising on the economic bene˚ts of 

cycling, including reduced road congestion 
reduced road maintenance, health and 
environment.
Walking and cycling are both active and 

sustainable forms of transport. 
Sydney™s 
Walking Future 
and Sydney™s Cycling Future
  are complementary strategies.

SYDNEY™S CYCLING FUTURE
DECEMBER 2013
CYCLING IN SYDNEY TODAY
Each year more people are choosing the 
convenience of riding a bike as their preferred 
mode of transport. Since 2006, the number 
of people riding to work has increased by 50 
per cent in metropolitan Sydney. Most of this 
increase in bike riding is occurring close to 
town centres, where people are choosing to live 
closer to where they work, shop and socialise.
Cycling is ideal for short distances of about 
 ˚ve kilometres or 20 minutes. Riding a bike 
can be quicker than a car for trips up to ˚ve 
kilometres, and faster than public transport for 
trips up to eight kilometres.
Even with the growing number of people 
 riding bikes, there is capacity to accommodate 
more riders.
Encouraging more people to cycle for transport 
and recreation will help to reduce the demand 
on other modes of transport. Well-placed 
cycling and walking networks can extend the 
catchment of the public transport system.
Existing cycleways
People need to be connected from where they 
live to key destinations. Although the NSW 
Government and local councils have been 
investing in developing bicycle networks across 
Sydney, there are a number of routes that are 
incomplete. To increase the number of people 
choosing to ride a bike, networks need to better 
connect with major employment centres or with 
other transport modes.

6SYDNEY™S CYCLING FUTURE
DECEMBER 2013
Where we cycle today and why 
People across Sydney cycle to get to various 
destinations, including the local shops, school, 

university or work. Every day in metropolitan 

Sydney, customers make more than 16 million 

trips that are less than 10 kilometres, this 

includes 392,000 bicycle trips Œ more than 

the number of trips undertaken on ferries 

each day. The cycling mode share for under 

10 kilometre trips in greater Sydney has grown 

from 1.9 per cent to 2.5 per cent since 2010.
Cycling and safety
Safety is a key factor that people consider 

when choosing to ride a bike. In inner Sydney, 

more than half of residents say they would ride 

a bike to work at least once a week if they could 

use a cycleway that is separated from motor 

vehicles. Customers want direct and connected 

routes with separate paths and more relevant 

information about trip planning to help them 

plan a safe journey. We also know that the 

number of injuries involving people on bikes has 

decreased where separated cycleways are built.
 Who is cycling?

Why are we cycling?
Who is cycling?
People ride their bike for di˜erent reasons. 
Bike riders vary in age, ˚tness, skill and 

con˚dence. About 70 per cent of people in 

NSW either ride regularly or would like to ride 

more and say they would if bike riding was 

made safer for them.
Why are we cycling?
Customers have told us that they are riding 

more where they:
 Feel safer and more con˚dent riding
 Have access to cycleways separated from 

motor vehicles, providing a safe and direct 

option for people who are not comfortable 

riding in tra˛c
 Have received better information to plan 

their trip and can easily connect to other 

modes of transport
 Have experienced the e˜ects of congestion 

on the roads and public transport system.

The bicycle experience Œ what our customers want
Our customers have told us that there are four major factors that in˝uence their choice to ride a 
bike to their destination.
1.
 Connectivity and separation
 Œ separated 
street space for bikes, more direct routes 
to destinations and improvements to the 
quality of roads for people on bikes.
2.
 Safe behaviour
 Œ increased road user 
awareness of road rules and safety, higher 
priority for bicycles at road intersections, 
increased enforcement of road rules, 
reduced speed limits in busy areas and 
 more responsible sharing of paths.
3.
 Supporting facilities
 Œ better lighting, more 
facilities that support riding during a trip, 
bike routes that connect to public transport 
and more bicycle parking facilities at public 
transport interchanges.
4.
 Health, wellbeing and con˚dence
 Œ more 
promotion and campaigns on the bene˚ts of 

riding a bike, trip planning and knowledge of 
local roads, more education and con˚dence 
courses, greater encouragement of social 
riding and increased knowledge of road 
rules by bicycle users.

DECEMBER 2013
CONNECTING BICYCLE NETWORKS
Our focus is on creating connected cycleways that are within ˚ve kilometres of activity centres and 
public transport interchanges. By focusing our e˛orts here we are aiming to increase opportunities 

for people to ride their bike for short to medium distances, and helping to reduce pressure on the 

transport system.
Achievements so far
 Completion of the North Ryde to 

Macquarie University cycleway
 Construction of the Wentworthville to 

Parramatta cycleway beside the M4
 Completing links to the M7 cycleway
 Fixing missing sections of the cycleway 

around Botany Bay
 Completing missing sections in the 

Prospect to Blacktown and Blacktown 
 
to Parramatta cycleways
 Ongoing improvements to the operation 

of innovative tra˛c lights, in partnership 

with the City of Sydney Council.
Prioritising cycle infrastructure 
We will prioritise bicycle infrastructure investment to ensure the projects that will have the 

biggest impact on encouraging more people to ride a bike are completed ˚rst. A four stage 

process will set out how infrastructure projects will be prioritised.
Figure 4˜
How we will prioritise cycle infrastructure projects
Step 1
Map catchments around centres 
 De˚ne a ˚ve kilometre bike riding catchment 
around each major centre Œ prioritise centres 

that attract a high number of short trips
Step 2
Pinpoint neighbourhood destinations
 Prioritise links to major destinations within 

each catchment Œ identify employment 

centres, schools, shops, recreational facilities
Step 3 
De˚ne strategic cycleways 
 Identify key paths to major destinations Œ 
ensuring they pass through high residential 

and employment areas
Step 4
Select appropriate route and 
infrastructure solutions 
Use existing infrastructure where possible, 
avoid unnecessary con˝ict with other modes, 

separation from pedestrians wherever possible
11SYDNEY™S CYCLING FUTURE
DECEMBER 2013
A hierarchy of cycleways
A hierarchy of safe cycleways to major centres 
will help to identify and prioritise key projects.
1 Regional bicycle corridors 
Œ highly used 
routes that connect to major destinations, 
on cycleways that are separate from 
motor vehicles and pedestrians. 
2 Local bicycle network
 Œ lower use 
corridors that connect to priority
 corridors and neighbourhood 
 destinations within catchments.
3 Quiet local streets
 Œ connecting residential 
destinations and local services in low tra˛c 
environments, design treatments make 
provision for people on bikes.
Getting the infrastructure right 
As cycling becomes more popular, the type, 
function and location of infrastructure built will 
be determined by customers™ requirements.
Future investment will aim for separation 
of bikes, vehicles and pedestrians wherever 
possible. Shared paths for bike riders and 
pedestrians will only be used where there 
 are no other options and will be carefully 
designed to minimise con˝ict.
New bicycle infrastructure will be guided by:
 Additional design options for separated 
cycleways on one or both sides of the 
 road, separate from both the footpath
 and tra˛c lanes
 New infrastructure guidelines for 
local˙councils
 Options for treatments where there are 
high numbers of bike riders and pedestrians 
sharing the same path. Guidance may 
include path width, level of separation and 
signs that advise speed
 Provision for temporary cycleway 
treatments, to allow innovative tra˛c 
management solutions to be piloted at low 
cost to councils and others.
Building cycle routes outwards 
from centres
Sydney™s major employment centres attract 
many people travelling a short distance to 
reach their destination. Investing in connected 
bike routes that are within ˚ve kilometres 
of major centres and public transport 
interchanges will help to increase bike riding 
for short trips. We will complete these 
cycleways in the short to medium term.
In the longer term, we will build a connected 
network of cycleways that provides access 
 to centres from a 10 kilometre catchment.
Figure 5˜
Infrastructure to match customer needs
12SYDNEY™S CYCLING FUTURE
DECEMBER 2013
Connecting centres
The Connecting Centres Program will help 
councils to complete local bicycle networks to 
major centres of metropolitan Sydney. Local 
government provides and maintains the majority 
of local bicycle infrastructure in NSW. Many of 
these local routes are delivered with 50 per cent 
partnership funding from the NSW Government.
The NSW Government will work with councils to 
identify and co-fund local bicycle infrastructure 
to connect local bicycle networks to key 
destinations. We will focus on completing links 
within a ˚ve kilometre catchment of major centres 
in the short term and expand to a 10 kilometre 
catchment in the longer term. One such link is the 
Sutherland to Sutherland Hospital cycleway for 
which the NSW Government has committed up 
to $2 million to work with Sutherland Council 
to identify the scope and cost, and progress 
detailed design of a proposed link between 
Sutherland and Cronulla transport interchanges.
Bicycle network plans will be developed with 
councils within ˚ve kilometre catchments of 
the following Major Centres:
 Sydney CBD

Completing the missing links 
Local bicycle networks can often be 
signi˚cantly improved by ˚xing minor missing 
links. We will continue to work with councils to:
 Identify and prioritise small projects that will 
signi˚cantly improve local cycle connectivity
 Address key pinch points 
 Increase safety.
Linking cycling to urban growth 
The NSW Government is focused on better 
long-term planning that integrates land use 
and transport. Locating the places that people 
want to travel to and from close to each 
other, and addressing how individual land 
developments can contribute to a cycleway 
network are essential to achieving this.
Transport for NSW will work with the Department 
of Planning and Infrastructure to achieve these 
outcomes, ensuring that land use planning and 
design supports a 10 kilometre bicycle catchment 
area around new developments and urban 
renewal projects. The NSW Government will 
work in partnership with developers to deliver 
bicycle networks to new communities. For 
example, we are working with the developer for 
a major new development. This will include a 
new bridge connecting Wentworth Point and 
Rhodes to allow residents to access shops, 
employment areas, public transport services and 
infrastructure on either side of Homebush Bay.

Bike and Ride Œ improving bike 
parking and information at 
public transport interchanges
Secure and convenient bicycle parking at 
transport interchanges makes it easier to access 
public transport services on a bike.
The Bike and Ride initiative will make it 
convenient for customers to ride to transport 
hubs, leave their bikes securely locked up 
 and transfer to public transport to continue 
their journey. Bicycle facilities will be 
progressively improved as transport 
interchanges are upgraded.
New bicycle parking and way˚nding facilities 
include:
 Bike racks in highly visible locations near 

interchange entrances 
 Maps of the local bicycle network
 Secure access bicycle parking facilities built 

at the busiest interchanges. Customers 
will be able to use these new facilities by 
registering for an access card or their Opal 
card in the longer term. Secure bicycle 
parking will be built into the design of new 
interchanges and commuter car parks. 
Unused space such as old station buildings 
can be used at existing interchanges.
The existing bike locker program will continue 

to be o˜ered at quieter interchanges, 
depending on customer demand.
Opportunities will be explored to work in 
collaboration with businesses to improve end

rooms and showers.
We will begin by installing secure bicycle 
facilities at the following transport interchanges 
across the network:
 Redfern Station
 Parramatta Station
 Penrith Station
 Blacktown Station
 Campbelltown Station
 Woy Woy Station
 Gosford Station
 Hornsby Station
We will continue to allow customers to take 
their bicycle on trains, ferries and light rail free 

of charge during o˜ peak times. Customers can 
take their folding bike free of charge at any 
time of day on a bus, train, ferry and light rail 
provided it is within designated size limits.
North West Rail Link 
New interchanges being built as part 
of the North West Rail Link will include 

secure bike parking and racks at all 

stations. We will also improve the local 

bicycle network to these interchanges 

and provide better trip planning 

information to customers wanting to 

continue their journey by train.

Providing for cycling through 
transport and development 
projects
By coordinating transport and land use 
development, planning for bicycles will be 
incorporated into the delivery of transport 
projects to support urban development 
and growth corridors. This will ensure 
people will be able to use a bike to travel 
short distances along major transport 
routes, and access stops and stations on 
new public transport lines.
The needs of people on bikes will be 
included throughout the planning 
of new and upgraded road, rail, bus 
and interchange projects, including 
corridor protection and the provision 
of infrastructure when projects are 
designed or constructed. Bicycle 

facilities will be identi˚ed and delivered 
parallel to major transport corridors, 
 in partnership with local councils.
Priority cycleways across 
Sydney 
The NSW Government will fund the provision 
of the major missing links in our priority cycle 
network within ˚ve kilometres of major centres. 
Priority routes have been identi˚ed for

PROMOTING CYCLING
Our customers value the ˝exibility and health bene˚ts of getting around on a bike. We will 
encourage more people to ride a bike for transport, and make better use of our existing 
networks by promoting these bene˚ts and providing meaningful information to customers.
Many good bicycle networks already exist and safely get thousands of people to work, school or 
appointments on their bikes every day. To make the most of these existing networks and the new links 
we build, we are developing a range of customer initiatives that will raise the pro˚le of bike riding as 
a fun, healthy, easy and ˝exible transport option. We will provide information to customers on how 
to plan a safe riding route to their destination. To make things safer for everyone, we will introduce 
initiatives to improve compliance with the bicycle related road rules when riding or driving on the road.
Getting more people on bikes
A large number of people know how to ride a 
bike and about one million households in the 
greater Sydney metropolitan area own a bike. 
Programs aimed at changing people™s travel 
behaviour can be e˜ective in getting more 
people to ride for transport.
We will use our customer research and feedback 
to develop tailor made approaches to remind 
people that, as well as enabling fun and healthy 
activity, their bike can provide an e˜ective, 
convenient and ˝exible way to get around Œ 
especially during peak times. Campaigns, social 
media and community engagement will play a 
vital role in building con˚dence and encouraging 
customers to ride for everyday transport.
As a result, customers will become more 
con˚dent in planning safe riding routes to their 
destination and remaining safe when sharing 

the road. 
Trip planning 
Providing easy to access, reliable and relevant 

information is key to increasing the mode 
share of cycling. By promoting existing bicycle 
networks, we can encourage more people to 
make better use of existing infrastructure. 
Not knowing where to ˚nd safe and convenient 
bicycle routes is a barrier for customers 
who don™t currently ride a bike as a mode of 
transport. Providing information about all the 
transport options available to customers can 
help when planning a trip.
We will explore options to enhance our trip 
planning support, including:
 On the Transport Info website customers will 
be able to quickly ˚nd the information they 
need to plan their trip
 Apps will be explored for bicycle route 
mapping and options
 Maps of the local bicycle network will be 

piloted, with future roll out to stations and 
interchanges in partnership with councils.
ACHIEVEMENTS SO FAR 
 Online maps and information to customers 
about existing bicycle infrastructure 
across the state.
 Customers can report a hazard online if 
they come across a hazard on their bike 
trip. In the past 12 months 230 hazards 
have been reported and quickly resolved. 
A further 300 online queries were also 
answered for bicycle customers in NSW.
 Bicycle infrastructure data is being used 

in˙smartphone maps and online trip 
planning tools.
 NSW Bike Week 2013 featured 63 events 
across the state that attracted more than 
12,500˙participants.
 A trial, community-based cycling skills and 
con˚dence training program was delivered 
in Western Sydney major centres (Penrith, 
Parramatta, Liverpool).
23SYDNEY™S CYCLING FUTURE
DECEMBER 2013
 Working with local councils, we will 
provide information about the local bike 
network, including connections to transport 
interchanges using a consistent approach to 
signage and maps. 
 We will support local councils and bicycle user 
groups to help new interested customers 
˚nd safe bicycle routes for their trip. 
Most people form their transport habits 

within two months of moving into a new 
area. Providing people with trip planning 
information about their local bicycle network 
can encourage them to consider cycling as a 
primary form of transport. 
The NSW Government will assist councils with 
providing information on cycling and other 
transport modes in new resident welcome packs.
Transport Management Associations
A Transport Management Association Œ a 

partnership between multiple levels of 
government and local businesses Œ is being 
piloted at Macquarie Park. We will explore 
opportunities to progressively rollout 
Transport Management Associations in 
other areas. These associations will support 
cycling in local communities through routes, 
facilities and ensure people have appropriate 
information and support.
Bicycle con˚dence courses
About 15 per cent of customers ride their bike 

infrequently and say that they would ride more 
if they were shown how to ride safely on their 
local bicycle routes. The NSW Government 
will partner with councils to o˜er regular 
bicycle courses, which aim to build people™s 
con˚dence and safety when riding. These 
courses will reinforce compliance with road 
rules and provide bike riders with practical ways 
they can be courteous towards other road and 
footpath users. These courses have contributed 
to substantial increases in safe bike riding 
when they are coordinated with infrastructure 
improvements and other promotional activities.
Travel choices
Habit often prevents people from thinking 

about alternative ways to commute to school, 

university or the workplace. We will support 

programs designed for everyday destinations 
to inform customers of their travel choices 
and provide incentives for them to ride. These 
programs will help ease congestion around key 
destinations at peak times.
Community events to encourage 
cycling
Through continued support of NSW Bike 
Week, we are encouraging local bike groups 
to organise events that promote bike riding 
as a safe and healthy mode of transport. 
NSW Bike Week 2013 featured 63 events 
across the state that attracted more than 
12,500 participants. Many of the events we™re 
family fun rides, allowing participants to ride 
in a safe environment, improving their skills 
and˙con˚dence.
Bicycle maintenance workshops and 
information on how the NSW road rules apply 
to people on bikes helps to increase safety 
and knowledge of rights and responsibilities. 
Community events that demonstrate local safe 
bicycle routes have also been successful in 

building people™s con˚dence riding a bike.

NSW Cycling Safety Strategy
With a growing number of people on bikes, 
it is important that both bike riders and 
motorists know how to act safely when on 
the road or path together. Transport for NSW 
is developing a Cycling Safety Strategy to sit 
alongside the NSW Road Safety Strategy 2012-
2021 that will focus on reducing serious injuries 
and fatalities as more people ride.
The strategy will adopt the safe systems 
approach to road safety, which takes a 
holistic view of the transport system and the 
interactions among the key components of the 
system Œ the road user, roadside, vehicles and 
addresses important factors such as speed.
The Cycling Safety Strategy will deliver a range 
of actions for bicycle riders and motorists 

to improve understanding and compliance 
with the road rules, raise awareness about 
importance of safe road interactions, improve 
bicycle safety skills and engagement between 
the government and bicycle user groups. In 
addition, there will be initiatives to promote 
safer road infrastructure bicycle safety 
features, and safety on shared paths.
Road Safety Education Program 
The Road Safety Education Program is a long- 
term integrated educational initiative. The 
program aims to increase students™ road safety 
knowledge, understanding and skills and to 
develop positive road user attitudes and safe 
behaviours in children and adolescents. This 
includes safe bicycle riding. Transport for 
NSW works closely with the Department of 
Education and Communities, the Association 
of Independent Schools of NSW and the 
Catholic Education Commission, on the 
development and delivery of road safety 
education resources in their implementation.
Community Bicycle and Road Safety 
Education facilities
Transport for NSW will continue to work to instil 
safe cycling practices into school age children. 
Many facilities exist for children to learn road 
skills and safe cycling practice away from live 
tra˛c. There are more than nine community 
bicycle and road safety education facilities, as 
well as numerous parks and o˜ road bicycle 
tracks that provide safe places for children 
to˙ride.

ENGAGING WITH PARTNERS
To increase the number of people riding a bike, we will work with local governments and land 
developers to improve bike facilities and promote bike riding.
Bike riding is a key focus for a number of NSW 
Government agencies and councils. 
Sydney™s 
Cycling Future
 focuses on bike riding for 
transport while recognising the e˜orts that are 

already underway in other policy areas such as 
health, planning, tourism and recreation. 
Policy initiatives that inform this strategy include:
 NSW Government™s 
NSW 2021: A plan to 
make NSW number one
 NSW Department of Planning and 
Infrastructure, 
Metropolitan Plan for Sydney. 
A New Planning System for NSW
 Transport for NSW, 
Sydney City Centre 
Access Strategy, Environment and 

Sustainability Framework
 Ministry of Health, 
NSW Healthy Eating and 
Active Living Strategy
. We will collaborate across the NSW 
Government to ensure that transport 
objectives contribute to these policy initiatives 
and are informed by experience and evidence. 
Working with local councils, land 
developers and peak bodies
To encourage bike riding, both the NSW 
Government and councils need to work 
together to improve facilities and promote bike 
riding. Local councils play an important role in 
providing infrastructure, managing local roads, 
and delivering promotion and information 
programs to support bike riding.
We will work with councils to deliver cycleway 
networks to help customers more easily access 
key activity centres. Together with councils, 
we will target missing links and problem 
intersections in local bicycle networks. We 
will revise guidelines to provide innovative 
and cost-e˜ective design options, including 
clearer standards for shared paths. We will 
work with developers to promote bike riding 

in community design. Importantly, we will 
also collaborate with peak bodies and interest 
groups, such as Bicycle NSW and other bicycle 
stakeholders to draw on their expertise and 
jointly deliver actions.
Achievements so far 
 The NSW Government is partnering with 

local government to plan and deliver 
the local bicycle network in and around 
our major centres. More than 60 km of 
local bicycle network has been rolled 
out in the past two years and planning 
is underway to complete safe bicycle 
networks within ˚ve kilometres of each 
major centre in metropolitan Sydney. 
 We are collaborating with community 
organisations and bicycle groups to 
create a better environment for cycling
 in NSW.
 Transport for NSW has recently 

partnered with the Amy Gillet Foundation 
focusing on promoting considerate 
interactions between people in cars and 
people on bikes.

Working with local councils 
The NSW Government will partner with
 23 councils in 2013-14 to deliver more than 20 
kilometres of local bicycle network around key 
activity centres in metropolitan Sydney from 
the Northern Beaches to the Blue Mountains
 to St George and Sutherland.
Transport for NSW will bring together groups 
of councils to coordinate, plan and prioritise 
the cycleway network within ˚ve kilometre 
catchments of Sydney™s metropolitan centres. 
Updated road and path design 
guidelines 
The NSW Government will update road and 
path guidelines given to local councils. 
 This will include:
 The integration of local area-wide bicycle 
plans into council Community Strategies
 Safe design treatments for shared 

pedestrian and cycleways, with a focus 
on cost-e˜ective solutions that promote 
pedestrian safety and comfort, manage 
bicycle travel speeds where needed, and
 minimise con˝ict.
Centres Design Guidelines 
The NSW Government is preparing 
Centres 
Design Guidelines
 to help developers of other 
major transport, residential and commercial 

projects achieve walking and cycle-friendly 
outcomes. Guidelines will address ways of 
supporting for pedestrians and bike riders by 
providing connected pathway networks in new 
suburbs, or including bicycle parking in new 
retail developments.
Bicycle user groups and peak bodies
The NSW Government continues to engage with 
bicycle users and local councils across the state.
We will continue to talk to our customers and 
stakeholders to monitor the implementation of 
Sydney™s Cycling Future
 and form partnerships 
to deliver actions.
Support existing health programs
We will work with the Ministry of Health and the 
O˛ce for Preventive Health on programs such 
as the Healthy Children Initiative, Active Travel 
to School and Healthy Workers Initiative.
We will also continue to support a range 
of existing programs run by NGOs that 
encourage people to choose cycling as their 
transport choice.

SYDNEY™S CYCLING FUTURE
DECEMBER 2013
WE LISTENED TO YOU
The development of 
Sydney™s Cycling Future 
draws on extensive consultation on the 
 NSW Long Term Transport Master Plan 
and 
customer research.
Consultation on the 
NSW Long Term Transport 
Master Plan
 included:
 Over 130,000 hits on our website
 Over 1,200 submissions from the community, 
industry and experts on the Discussion Paper
 Over 480 submissions on the draft Plan
 Consultation with customer, transport 

specialist, industry and local government 
advisory groups
 Over 1,000 attendees at regional forums.
Submissions to the draft Plan focused on 
the importance of cycling in addressing 

congestion and improving the public transport 
system. The majority of submissions about 
bike riding focused on improving safety 
and increasing the bicycle as a mode of 
transport. Customers identi˚ed issues related 
primarily to the limited network of connected 
cycleways that are separated from tra˛c. 
Submissions sought recognition of the bicycle 
as a legitimate and priority mode of transport 
to be integrated into land use planning and 
connected with other modes of transport.
28Before 
Sydney™s Cycling Future
 I don™t know where to access reliable 

information to plan my ride so I can 
use dedicated cycleways
 The dedicated cycleways near my 
house do not connect to my local 
town centre
 I don™t have the right gear and I™m not 
that con˚dent on my bike
 I don™t know where to store my bike 

when I get to the interchange.
When undertaking customer research, four 

broad themes emerged in what customers told 
us was important in their bike journey:
1.
 Connectivity and separation 
Œ Our 
customers would like to see separated 

street space for bikes, more direct routes 
to destinations and improvements to the 
quality of roads for people on bikes.
2.
 Safe behaviour 
Œ Our customers would like 
to see increased road user awareness of 

bicycle road rules and safety, higher priority 
for bicycles at road intersections, increased 
enforcement of road rules, reduced speed 
limits in busy areas and more responsible 
sharing of paths.
3.
 Supporting facilities 
Œ Our customers 
would like better lighting, more facilities 

that support riding during a trip, bike routes 
that connect to public transport and more 
facilities at public transport interchanges.
4.
 Health, wellbeing and con˚dence 
Œ Our 
customers would like to see more promotion 

and campaigns on the bene˚ts of riding 
a bike, more education and con˚dence 
courses, greater encouragement of social 
cycling and increased knowledge of road 
rules by bicycle users.
After 
Sydney™s Cycling Future
 Riding a bike is an easy and convenient 
way to get around, anyone can do it
 I can easily ride my bike on a quiet 

local street to connect to the new 
dedicated cycleway that will safely 
take me to my local town centre
 After attending a free course 

organised by my council, I feel much 

more con˚dent and aware of the road 

rules on my bike
 I™ve planned my trip using 

transportnsw.info and I can safely 
 get to local destinations without 
having to dress di˜erently
 It™s so easy to store my bike a 

secure bicycle parking facility at the 
interchanges and jump on a bus, train, 
ferry or light rail to complete my journey.

 2016  Preface
 The Asset Standards Authority (ASA) is an independent unit within Transport for NSW (T
fNSW) 
and is the network design and standards authority for defined NSW transport assets. 
 The ASA is responsible for developing engineering governance frameworks to support industry 
delivery in the assurance of design, safety, integrity, construction, and
 commissioning of 
Transport assets for the whole asset life cycle. In order to achieve this, the ASA effectively 
discharges obligations as the authority for various technical, process, and planning matters 

across the asset life cycle.
 The ASA collaborates with industry using stakeholder engagement activities to assist in 
achieving its mission. These activities help align the ASA to broader government expectations 

of making it clearer, simpler, and more attractive to do business within the NSW transport 
indu
stry, allowing the supply chain to deliver safe, efficient, and competent transport services.
 The ASA develops, maintains, controls, and publishes a suit
e 
of standards and other 
documentation for 
TfNSW 
transport assets. Further, the ASA ensures that these standards are 
performance
-based to create opportunities for innovation and improve access to a broader 
competitive supply chain.
 Sydney™s Cycling Future
 presents a new direction in the way we plan, prioritise and provide for 
bicycling facilities in Sydney.
 This standard sets 
out 
the minimum requirements for bicycle 
parking and storage facilities, as bicycle parking facilities form part of the 'Bike and Ride' 
initiative of 
Sydney's Cycling Future
. 
This document has been developed by the ASA in consultation w
ith other 
TfNSW 
divisions and 
agencies
 and has been approved by the ASA Configuration Control Board.
 This standard
 supersedes the bicycle facilities requirements of ESB 003

 the customers
 to continue their journey,
 who use both bicycles and 
public transportation
 in their commute
. 2. Purpose
 The purpose of this standard is to define the types of bicycle facilities that 
can
 be installed at
 transport interchanges
. 
This standard specifies
 the
 design
 and location
 requirements of such 
facilities
. 
2.1. Scope
 This document sets out the minimum design requirements for the
 installation of
 bicycle facilities.
 2.2. Application 
This standard applies t
o all

 2018  Preface
 The 
Asset Standards Authority (ASA) is a key strategic branch of Transport for NSW (TfNSW). 
As the network design and standards authority for NSW Transport Assets, as specified in the 
ASA Charter
, the ASA identifies, selects, develops, publishes, maintains and controls a suite of 
requirements documents on behalf of TfNSW, the asset owner.
 The ASA deploys TfNSW requirements for asset and safety assurance by creating and 
managing TfNSW's governance models, documents and processes. To achieve this, the ASA 
focuses on four primary tasks:
  publishing and managing TfNSW's process and requirements documents including TfNSW 
plans, standards, manuals and guides
  deploying TfNSW's Authorised Engineering Organisation (AEO) framework
  continuously improving TfNSW™s Asset Management Framework
  collaborating with the Transport cluster and industry through open engagement
 The AEO framework authorises engineering organisations to supply and provide asset related 

products and services to TfNSW.
 It works to assure the safety, quality and fitness for purpose of 
those products and services over the asset's whole
-of-life. AEOs are expected to demonstrate 
how they have applied the requirements of ASA documents, including TfNSW plans, standards 
and guides, when delivering assets and related services for TfNSW.
 Compliance with ASA requirements by itself is not sufficient to ensure satisfactory outcomes for 
NSW Transport Assets. The ASA expects that professional judgement be used by competent 

personnel w
hen using ASA requirements to produce those outcomes.

  Preface
 The Asset Standards Authority (ASA) is an independent unit within Transport for NSW (TfNSW) 
and is the network design and standards authority for defined NSW transport assets. 
 The ASA is responsible for developing engineering governance frameworks to support industry 
delivery i
n the assurance of design, safety, integrity, construction, and commissioning of 
transport assets for the whole asset life cycle. In order to achieve this, the ASA effectively 
discharges obligations as the authority for various technical, process, and planning matters 
across the asset life cycle.
 The ASA collaborates with industry using stakeholder engagement activities to assist in 
achieving its mission. These activities help align the ASA to broader government expectations 

of making it clearer, simpler, and more attractive to do business within the NSW transport 
industry, allowing the supply chain to deliver safe, efficient, and competent transport services.
 The ASA develops, maintains, controls, and publishes a suite of standards and other 
documentation for transport assets of TfNSW. Further, the ASA ensures that these standards 

are performance
-based to create opportunities for innovation and improve access to a broader 
competitive supply chain.

is a key activity that is performed in the concept stage of the TfNSW system life cycle.
 An OCD is required to understand the operations of the new or altered system, and therefore 

the cost involved to operate over the expected system life time until retirement.
 The OCD is an interim informing document that forms the link between the desired service and 

the business case and requirements to meet that service. It also provides additional assurance 

that the system solution is
 more likely to meet those objectives.
  
The 
Operation Concept Definition 
development 
guide
 provides guidance for the development of 
OCDs on heavy rail transport projects ranging from simple to highly complex
 following a 
structured
 approac
h. 
This
 guide may be updated as improved best practice emerges in the development of OCDs.
 2. Purpose
 The purpose of this 
OCD 
development 
guide
 is to provide guidance in complying with the 
requirements stated in T
 MU AM 06008
 ST Operations Concept Definition
. 
The initial objective is to align this guide to rail planning projects, and then extend 
it to 
application across the wider transport cluster in other transport modes.
 2.1. Scope
 This guide refers directly to the mandatory operational concept requirements stated in 
T 
MU AM 06008
 ST 
Operational Concept Definition Development
, which are quoted in the 
relevant sections of this document.
 This document is neither an OCD nor a mandated template for an OCD. It provides guidance to 
ensure all key operational aspects of a transport investment project are considered and defined 

to support the development of a robust business case and business requirements.
 Definition of business requirements that may be derived from an OCD is described in 
T 
MU AM 06007
 GU 
Guide to Requirements De
finition and Analysis
. 
While this guide describes how to define the whole
-of-life operational concept for new or altered 
systems, it does not describe how life cycle costs are derived. For information on deriving life 
cycle costs, refer to T

  The transport network 
investment capabi
lity and capacity planning
 entity
 - 
sponsor and 
owner of the OCD and BRS, and developer of the business case and business 

requirements
  The freight 
transport 
service customer engagement
 entity
 - 
freight demand identification  
through freight customer inputs
  Transport 
capital program 
delivery
 entities
 - 
project development including BRS and SRS, 
and review and agreement on CapEx costs
  Transport operators and maintainers (O&M) 
- 
operating the new or altered system, and 
review of expected OpEx costs
  AEOs 
providing technical advisor support to TfNSW in preparing an OCD
 Application of this guide is constrained to passenger and freight rail transport systems initially, 

with planned future extension of application to other TfNSW transport modes.
 This guide should be applied at a scalable level for the following operational scenarios:
  transport (integrated) network level 
- 
including all transport modes
  transport mode level (with initial focus on heavy rail transport)
  transport corridor level 
- 
initially rail cor
ridors, eventually ferry and bus routes
  local sites and multimodal sites, for example, interchanges, stations, yards, depots, control 
centres and junctions
 This guide is applied in the 'concept' and 'specify' phases of the asset life cycle, before finalisi
ng 
the business case and request for full funding from the NSW Treasury. The concept and specify 

phases are identified in the TfNSW asset life cycle model in T
 MU AM 06006
 ST 
Systems 
Engineering
. 
The elements described in this guide should be tailored and scaled to suit the particular needs 
of each transport investment project, program or portfolio. Not every element of this guide 
applies to every project, and the user should select only those elements that apply.

  The physical solution may not be defined at
 the early stages of the system life cycle. An 
operational concept is developed around an assumed range of asset types, which may change 
as user needs are synthesised into a physical solution.

  5. Operations concept definition
 Section 
5.1
 through Section 
5.7
 provides background information on OCD development and 
offers guidance on
 complying with the
 requirements around roles, responsibilities, and 
resources for OCD development for TfNSW transport projects as stipulated in 
T 
MU AM 06008
 ST 
Operations Concept Definition.
 For purposes of clarity the transport network investment capability and capacity planning entity
 (hereafter referred to as the 'transport planner') was previously known as the Planning and 
Programs Division (PPD) when T
 MU AM 06008
 ST was published.
 5.1. Need for operations concept definition
 OCD development is a key activity that is performed during the concept stage early in the 

TfNSW systems life cycle. 
 An OCD is required in order to understand the operations of new
 or altered system and 
therefore the cost involved to operate over the expected system lifetime until retirement.
 The OCD is the means to translate the initial service demand or need into a credible set of 

operational and business requirements, based on which a robust system design is developed.
 The OCD as an artefact of the systems engineering (SE) methodology is intended to provide 

cohesion between operations, timetable, human factors and assets.
 The operational concepts articulated in the OCD should align with the maintenance concept 

definition (MCD), in order to assure that both operation and maintenance of the new or altered 
system is considered in an integrated way over its lifetime. The MCD may be merged with the 
OCD to form a single integrated docume
nt.
 The OCD is a mandatory predecessor to a system concept design, business case (and the 
funding request), and the final business requirements specification (BRS).
 A well
-developed OCD saves time, money, and rework and improve customer satisfaction early 
in the system life cycle, and therefore makes good business sense.
 5.2. OCD development responsibility 
T 
MU AM 06008
 ST states the following requirement:
 "Planning and Programs Division (PPD) of TfNSW shall be responsible for producing 

the OCD and business requirements that support it"
 The 
transport planner
 is responsible for producing the OCD and retains accountability for the 
business case and the supporting business requirements.

 Operational Concept Definition
 Version 1.0
 Issued date:
 28 May 2015
  However, there may be certain cases where the transport planner does not have the capability 
at the time to produce the OCD, in which case this responsibility should be agreed and 
delegated to the appropriate alternative entity within TfNSW who can produce the OCD. 
 For example, there may be situations where the O&M is considering 
mak
ing
 relatively minor 
changes. That is changes that are not of a significant capital value, to the way in which it will 
carry out rail operations or maintenance, in order to more effectively deliver against its 
contractual commitments.
 However, the default 
responsibility lies with 
the transport planner
 for the purposes of 
compliance to the OCD standard multiple stakeholder engagement.
 T 
MU AM 06008
 ST states the following requirement:
 "Authorised and relevant stakeholders shall be consulted during developmen
t of an 
OCD"
 Key stakeholders should be engaged in defining and agreeing the operations and maintenance 
of new or altered system over its lifetime due to the multi
-stakeholder nature of a railway 
operational concept change. 
 Stakeholders involved in the development of OCD should be authorised and relevant to the 
proposed change. In order to avoid the problem of excessive stakeholders, each relevant 
organisation should authorise a representative for their interests in the development of the 
OCD, and that representative should engage in the development of the OCD during the concept 

and specify stages.
 Lack of engagement at the appropriate time, followed by late objections to operational concepts 
during the later phases of the project can have adverse effects on time, cost, quality, risk and 
system acceptance.
 Stakeholders involved should be relevant to the OCD under development. For example, it would 

be inappropriate to involve station operators in developing the operational concept for a stabling 
yard or fleet
 maintenance depot, and vice versa.
 The following authorised stakeholders may be consulted in developing and agreeing an OCD, 
depending on the scope and type of the proposed new or altered system:
  The transport services contract manager
  
 The passenger transport service customer engagement entity
  
 The transport network investment capability and capacity planning
 entity
  The freight transport service customer engagement entity
  
 Transport 
capital program 
delivery entities

  Local Councils
 Authorised 
representatives of the key stakeholders (as applicable to the proposed new or 
altered system) should review and approve the OCD.
 T 
MU AM 06008
 ST states the following requirement:
 "The OCD shall be reviewed and approved by the authorised and relevant 
stakeholders"
 These stakeholders and their authorised representatives should actively engage and consult in 
development of the operational concepts associated with the proposed new or altered system, 

in order to minimise risk associated with timely approval of the OCD.
 5.3. Preparation of OCD
 T MU AM 06008 ST states the following requirement:
 "PPD shall refer to T MU AM 06008 GU Operations Concept Definition Development 

Guide for guidance in preparing the OCD"
 This guide is intended to elaborate on and provide guidance to comply with the OCD standard, 

but does not mandate the approach to be followed.
 The following suggested (non
-mandated) process may be followed for preparing an OCD:
  identify source documents that set out high level demand and transport goals, for example 
the Long Term Transport Master Plan (LTTMP), Freight and Ports Strategy, or Sydney's 
Rail Future, and supporting operational performance capabilities, including draft service 

timetable
  develop a plan, resources, and schedule for developing the OC
D, identifying and engaging 
with key stakeholders, and reviewing and approving the OCD
  develop models of the service required to support the draft timetable, to be used as a basis 
for developing operational concepts
  develop the OCD via a consultative process led by a core group and supported by advisors 

who represent a range of disciplines and functional areas (operations, maintenance, 
engineering, business, asset management, customers, project development and delivery)

 5.4. Coordination with other OCDs
 In the complex and interrelated world of rail transport, and within the wider multi
-modal public 
and freight transport network, a project introducing new or altered systems should consider the 
operational concepts and needs of other projects and modes.
 T 
MU AM 06008
 ST states the following requirement:
 "Development of individual project and program OCDs shall be coordinated with other 

OCDs that are in development or may already
 exist, to ensure that optimisation of one 
element of the rail network does not adversely affect other elements of the network."
 The team responsible for leading the development of the OCD should ensure that it is aware of, 

and that it makes other parties aware of changes to operational concepts that affect different 

parts of the wider transport network. If the team is not within the transport planner, it should 
consult with 
the transport planner
 to ensure that there are no inconsistencies between different
 parties working on OCDs.
 Examples of changes to operational concepts affecting other projects or modes can include the 
following:
  changes to passenger service operations on a line, junction or interchange may have 

impacts on concurrent changes in freight services and associated operational concepts

   increased services arriving at a particular transport interchange, without consideration of 
the need for additional bus services, taxi ranks or private motor vehicle parking
  introduction of driverless 
trains on 
a line that previously had driver
-based operations may 
impact on stabling yard operations, network management and line control operations
  freight
-related operational changes, for example, introduction of digital train radio on freight 
trains, or freight corridor projects
 The transport planner, in consultation with stakeholders across the transport cluster, should 
ensure that OCDs are in coordination.
 T 
MU AM 06008
 ST states the following requirement:
 "OCD information for all rail projects and programs shall
 be coordinated and managed 
by PPD"
 The OCD should be developed in conjunction with the MCD, to ensure that they align. In some 

cases it may be practical to merge maintenance concepts with operations concepts into a single 
integrated OCD, as the two elements are often interdependent on one another.
 5.5. Resources and tools for developing OCD
 T 
MU AM 06008
 ST states the following requirement:
 "The OCD shall be prepared by authorised staff with appropriate competencies"
 Appropriate competencies required to support
 the OCD (and related MCD) development 
includes the following:
  transport strategy and planning
  portfolio development and management
  stakeholder engagement and communication
  transport economics
  transport statistical analysis
  transport service modelling (for
 example flow models, timetable modelling)
  transport operations analysis, design and development
  options analysis and cost benefit analysis

   human factors integration

 A single individ
ual may not have all of the above competencies at a sufficient proficiency level, 
and therefore 
a core team may be formed with the required blend of competencies, and to 
engage with authorised stakeholders to develop a robust OCD.
 T 
MU AM 06008
 ST states the following requirement:
 "Operational concepts and associated operational performance capabilities defined in 

the OCD shall be developed and verified using suitable transport performance 

modelling tools"
 Modelling and simulation is a virtual approximate representation of the real world that allows 

investigation and, in some cases, prediction of future outcomes. Usually a specialised computer 

based application is needed to facilitate the modelling and simulation.
 Many tools are available to support the analysis and validation of a proposed change to service 
and associated operational concept. Following are some modelling and simulation tools used to 
develop and verify and validate operational concepts:
  RailSys: simulates rail operations using information about infrastructure, timetable, rolling 
stock and delays
  MTRAIN: models the train paths associated with the timetable
  FABEL: operational simulation of electrical traction systems
  TRAIL: model performance of train services (timetable) over a prescribed period
 of time 
addressing infrastructure and train reliability, maintenance and logistics strategy and 
operation strategy

 ST states the following requirement:
 "This standard shall be applied in the plan (concept and specify) phase of the system

Treasury"
 The OCD should be prepared during the ‚Plan™ phase of the TfNSW asset lifecycle, following 

demand analysis, transport modelling, and analysis of different service and 
timetable options, in 

order to select and define the operational concept for the preferred option.
 The concept stage (when the OCD is produced) of the Plan phase is identified in the TfNSW 
asset life cycle model in T
 MU AM 06006
 ST 
Systems Engineering
. 
The
 OCD should be produced in conjunction with the MCD document, to ensure that the two 
documents align. The MCD may follow the OCD slightly due to the primary need to define the 

operations to support the service demand, and maintenance of assets (that is the
 MCD) in order 
to support the operational capability.
 The OCD provides input to the development of the preferred concept design, business case 
(and funding request to NSW Treasury), and final business requirements spe

  6. Operational performance capability
 T 
MU AM 06008
 ST requires the OCD to identify operational performance capabilities and 
agreed performance measures. These capabilities should address transport enterprise 
objectives, future operational capabilities, and rationale for operational change.
 6.1. Transport objec
tives
 T 
MU AM 06008
 ST states the following requirement:
 "The OCD shall ensure that TfNSW enterprise level goals and objectives are identified 
and traced to the required operational capabilities, operational concept activities, 
organisation and assets"
 In 
order to develop an operational concept (and associated maintenance concept), TfNSW 
enterprise level goals and objectives should be identified, understood and traced to the required 
supporting operational capabilities, supporting concept activities, organisation and assets.
 Transport objectives should be supported by a clear vision and strategy that clearly articulates 
the transport service of the future, in broad terms of achieving this service.
 At the highest level, TfNSW Long Term Transport Master Plan (LTTMP) goals are identified to 
ensure that an integrated transport service is provided across all modes and geographic areas.
 The LTTMP is supported and elaborated at the transport mode level in the following strategies:
  Sydney's Rail Future
  Sydney's Light
 Rail Future
  Sydney's Ferry Future
  Sydney's Bus Future
  Sydney's Cycling Future
  Sydney's Walking Future
  Freight and Ports Strategy
 These objectives are achieved by identifying the future transport operational capability.
 The systematic identification and synthesis of operational activities and functions to support the 
TfNSW objectives and capabilities, is supported by using an architectural framework and model 
that applies a consistent set of specification rules.
 The architectural framework is based on the TRAK metamodel developed by the Rail Safety 
Standards Board (RSSB) in the UK. This was also used to develop the Deep Tube Railway

provide a basis for validating achievement of higher level enterprise goals.
 T 
MU AM 06008
 ST states
 the following requirement:
 "Operational capability metrics shall be defined to support the operational concepts in 

the OCD"
 Metrics may include, but are not necessarily limited to the following operational capabilities:
  network
-level capability metrics (f
or example, timetable capacity, degraded capacity)
  fleet capability metrics (for example
, 
passenger capacity, maximum speed, comfort levels)
  station and transport interchange capability metrics (for example, total capacity, passenger 

flow rates)
  infrastruc
ture capability metrics (for example, axle loading, gauging, traction power 
capacity)
  control and communications capability metrics (for example, trains per hour, signalling 
headway)
  stabling yard capability metrics (for example, number of trains, train type, length)
  fleet maintenance depot capability metrics (for example, number of trains at a time)
  environmental, congestion, noise and emission metrics
 The OCD should support the introduction and use of new, novel systems and technologies.
 Examples of new technologies associated with new operational concepts include Barangaroo 
Hub (semi floating pontoons), Light Rail (wireless traction), NWRL (driverless trains), Digital 

Train Radio System (DTRS) and Advanced Train Control System (ATCS).

 Operational Concept Definition
 Version 1.0
 Issued date:
 28 May 2015
  T 
MU AM 06008
 ST states the following requirement:
 "The OCD shall justify the rationale and expected performance capability benefits of a 
proposed operational change to the transport ne
twork"
 The OCD provides justification for any change in operational capability and should identify clear, 
measurable expected benefits to support the business case for the change. These benefits 

should be defined in terms of capital expenditure (CapEx) and
 operational expenditure (OpEx).
 6.3.1.
 Recording of assumptions
 T 
MU AM 06008
 ST states the following requirement:
 "The assumptions that underpin the rationale and expected performance capabilities 

shall be identified"
 Since the OCD is developed very early in the system life cycle during the concept and specify 
phases, unknown factors may only be clarified later, when a particular system solution has been 
selected.
 All assumptions should be recorded and continued to be tested as the solution becomes 

apparent late
r in the 'procurement' and 'design' phases of the life cycle.
 For example, the OCD may assume that the operational change will be based on continued use 

of the 1500
 V 
dc traction power supply option, but later option development during the reference 
design
 and system requirements development may determine that longer term operational life 

cycle cost savings can only be achieved by changing to 25
 kV ac traction power.
 7. Operational constraints
 Operational constraints are any limitations of a physical, geographic, policy, industrial relations 

or security nature, that place limits on the range of options to be considered when developing 
an operational concept. 
 T 
MU AM 06008
 ST states the following requirement:
 "The OCD shall describe any constraints applicable to a proposed operational 
change"
 Operational constraints may include, but are not necessarily limited to the following:
  service operating hours, such as 24/7 operation, night time shutdown,
 weekday, weekend, 
and holiday hours
  operating staff constraints, for example, staff numbers, capabilities, and competencies
  operating staff facilities, such as mess facilities, ablutions, rest areas, and proximity to 

services

   easy access constraints, for example, mobility constraints and constraints due to hearing 
and vision impairment
  transport interchange access constraints, such as pedestrian, cycle, car, bus, taxi, light rail, 

ferry
  industrial relations, such as industry collective bargaining agreement
s 
 safety constraints, for example, 
Rail Safety (Adoption of National Law) Act 2012
 and the 
Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator (ONRSR) requirements
  technology, system design and asset performance constraints
  security issues, for example, issues related to being on or near high crime areas, 

vandalism, and trespass
  geographic limits, for example, locations on or near hills, mountains, waterways, cuttings, 

embankments, and tunnels
  flood and drainage constraints, for example, constraints as a result of
 being on or near low 
lying flood plains, marshes, catchments, and run
-offs
  environmental constraints, for example, constraints due to being on or near protected flora 
and fauna sites, noise and other emissions
  heritage constraints, for example, constraints due to being on or near historical and 
Aboriginal sites
 There may be additional operational constraints unique to a specific project.
 8. Operational service levels
 T 
MU AM 06008
 ST states the following requirement:
 "The OCD shall adopt a layered approach to
 transport operational service levels for 
planning and decision
-making"
 This may be achieved by categorising operational services into the following levels:
  Level 1 
- 
strategic
  Level 2 
- 
tactical
  Level 3 
- 
operational
 8.1. Level 1 - 
Strategic
 This level is 
policy
-based and applicable to high complexity systems, with a transport network or 
mode
-wide scope, and network or mode
-wide implications. 
 It deals with long
-term change, and is non
-routine.

  Page 
26 of 
64  T MU AM 0
6008 GU
 Operational Concept Definition
 Version 1.0
 Issued date:
 28 May 2015
  At this level, the pattern of service is determined for the wo
rking timetable in effect.
 Examples of strategic level operational concepts are decisions to introduce a rapid transit metro 
service, or driverless trains, or change the traction electrification to 25
 kV ac across the network.
 8.2. Level 2 - Tactical 
This level
 is plan, process and procedure
-based, dealing with how to achieve policy and 
strategy, and focuses on medium complexity systems. 
 It deals with medium
-term operational arrangements for achieving service and timetables, 
routing and regulation. 
 At this lev
el, parameters are set for service regulation and intervention decisions.
 Examples of tactical operational concepts may be an existing corridor or junction performance 
upgrade, additional traction substations to provide additional capacity, or signalling u
pgrades.
 8.3. Level 3 - Operational 
This level deals with routine operations and decisions in each operational area of the transport 

mode, including degraded and emergency operations, short
-term changes, and is routine. 
 At this level, day
-to-day decisions are made on routing and regulating train services under 
abnormal conditions, excluding incident management. Decisions on what regulation and 

intervention is required are based on parameters set at level 2. 
 This level involves activities from operating trains and granting movement authorities, including 
routing, through to implementing decisions made at level 2 on regulation and intervention.
 9. Operational
 assets and facilities
 All rail transport operations require some form of physical assets or support facilities. The assets 

and facilities required to support the operational concept and its associated services should be 
described.

  10. Operational process scenarios
 The identification of operational process scenarios is the core of the OCD, and these are often 
wri
tten in a style that brings together operational assets, operational roles, operational service 
levels, and operational modes in the process description.
 T MU AM 06008
 ST states the following requirement:
 "The OCD shall identify and describe relevant opera
tional process scenarios"
 The OCD should describe how the transport system operators interact with each other, with 

customers, with external parties, and with the operational assets and facilities, in order to carry 

out services under various operational s
cenarios.
 Depending on a particular project, an OCD selects only those operational process scenarios 

that are relevant to the scope. For example, an OCD for a new fleet stabling yard project may 

select only stabling yard scenarios and some elements of trai
n operations scenarios that are 
applicable to operating trains into, within, and out of the stabling yard.
 This guide is focused on heavy rail operations, but the high
-level structure and principles of the 
standard and this guide can facilitate expansion a
nd application to other transport modes.
 Operational process scenarios that are defined in the OCD may include, but are not limited to 
the following, which are explored in detail in Section 
10.1
 through to Section 
10.10
:  network
-level management, that is the network level operations of NSW rail assets owned 
by TfNSW, and managed and operated by NSW rail transport agencies
  line (or corridor) management, that 
is specific lines and their unique and interconnected 
operations
  signal or area control, that is the division of a line into multiple signal control areas
  electrical switching, that is switching of traction power on the supply and load side
  stabling yard, 
that is yard entry and exit, and internal yard operations
  fleet depot, that is depot entry and exit, and internal depot operations
  train, that is driver, guard and revenue protection operations on the train
  station and interchange 
  freight terminal 
  security, incident management and response
 Figure 
2 describes a layered view of operations within the TfNSW transport network. The outer 
layer identifies all modes of 
transport. 
 The second layer indicates the rail network operations and operational interfaces with other 
transport modes.

  The third layer identifies all rail services in terms of lines or rail corridors that comprise the rail 
network collection of operati
ons.

  Changes in operations from existing operational arrangements may require a skills assessment 
or reassessment, in order to determine if current operational staff competencies match the tasks 
to be performed under new operational arrangements. For example, removal of guards and 
introduction of driver only operation may place additional tasks on the driver in terms of 

managing the platform
-train interface. 
 Closure of a mechanical signal box and relocation to a central signalling contr
ol centre with 
computerised
 traffic control systems, require re
-skilling of operations staff on new systems and 
operational procedures.
 Conversion of a stabling yard to fully signalled operation and removal of traditional yard staff 

places additional skills demands on drivers and guards.
 Identification of operational users and their interaction with operational assets and processes 
should consider human factors as explained in T

Factors Integration.
 13. Operations migration
 T MU 
AM 06008
 ST states the following requirement:
 "The OCD shall describe how operations will be safely migrated from existing 

operations to the future operations, including possible interim operations so far as is 
reasonably practical at this stage of knowledge of the technology related to the new or 

altered assets"
 Due to the complex nature of integrated railway operations, and the need to safely maintain 
services while introducing new or altered systems to meet a new operational need, making a full 
change 
in a single step is impractical.
 The normal approach is to plan and execute the migration from existing to future operations as 

a series of intermediate configurations, while supporting interim timetables and services. 
 13.1. 
Existing operations
 The OCD should describe the baseline existing operations against which the introduction of the 
new or altered assets and associated operations, will take place.
 13.2. 
Future operations 
- 
Interim
 The implementation of a highly complex new or altered system onto the transport network is 
unlikely to occur in a single stage of work.
 New or altered systems may be introduced in a series of interim stages. The OCD should 

describe the operational migration arrangements associated with these interim stages.

 ST states the following requirement:
 "The OCD shall describe arrangements to preserve acceptable levels of safety, 
timetabled services, efficiency, asset integrity, and service availability during 
operations migration"
 The operational migration arrangements associated with introducing new or altered transport 
systems should be clearly identified, in order to ensure that the integrity of existing transport 
network assets and associated operational availability and safety is maintained, so far as is 

reasonably practicable. 
 Migration arrangements include, but are n
ot necessarily limited to the following:
  safety 
- 
how existing operational safety will be maintained
  efficiency 
- 
how operational efficiency will be maintained

 14. Operational interfaces
 T MU AM 06008 ST states the following requ
irements:
 "The OCD shall identify and describe operational interfaces", 
and
 "Interfaces with internal or external organisations associated with assets across the 
interface shall be identified"
 Careful consideration should be given 
while
 identifying and def
ining operational interfaces when 
developing an OCD.

  An OCD should include operational interfaces that involve changes in technology or operational 
philosophy or responsibility. This may include the following:
  internal or external operational interfaces
  operational roles (identification of communicating parties)
  means of communication (voice, data, video, visual/audio)
  what is communicated (decisions, information sharing, actions)
  communications protocol and process (direction, acknowledgement, allocation 
of 
responsibility)
 All operational interfaces should be recorded centrally so that they can be independently 

reviewed by multiple operational stakeholders, in line with agreed performance measures, 
timetable and other operational measures.
 Changes to operational interfaces should be under configuration control.
 14.1. Internal operational interfaces 
The heavy rail network has many internal operational interfaces, and the OCD should describe 
the way these operational interfaces work. These internal operational interfaces may include, 

but are not necessarily limited to the following:
  network management, including line control and infrastructure control, to others
  signal and area control to others
  stations and interchanges to others
  train to others
  maintenance depots,
 including signals, telecommunications, civil, track, and electrical to 
others
  fleet depot to others
  stabling yard to others
 14.2. External operational interfaces 
The heavy rail passenger and freight network has operational interfaces with other transport 

modes.
 The OCD should describe the way these operational interfaces work. These external 
operational interfaces to other transport modes may include the following:
  light rail, including CBD and South East Light Rail, Newcastle, Parramatta light rail
  rapid transi
t, including North West Rail Link and future rapid transit route extensions

MU AM 06008
 ST states the following requirement:
 ﬁThe OCD shall describe how the system will operate under different operating modes 

so far as is reasonably practical at this stage of knowledge of the technology related to 

the new or altered assetsﬂ
 The nature of complex systems such as the transport system, and in particular the rail transport 
system, is that they can fail to a greater or lesser extent. In order to address this issue, the 
following should be identified:
  how the system may fail
  to what extent it may fail
  the arrangements needed to be in place to ensure some suitable level of business 

continuity until full functionality and performance is restored

 15.5. Maintenance or possession mode 
The OCD should identify maintenance or possession mode operations, for example, service 
arrangements around weekend or night time track work. The management of maintenance or 
possession mode operations should also be identified and may include, but are not necessarily 

limited to the following:
  service preparation before to possession or maintenance
  service management during possession or maintenance
  service recovery after possession or maintenance
  access arrangements for maintenance / possession regime
 15.6. 
Response and recovery to normal mode
 T 
MU AM 06008 ST states the following requirements:
 "The OCD shall describe arrangements that will be implemented following an incident 

or when the service deviates from normal t
o abnormal, degraded or emergency 
levels",
 and
 "The OCD shall describe the incident management organisation required to implement 

special command and control processes"
 The aim of the incident management and control organisation and processes is to 
safeguard 

customers, employees and assets during incidents, and to facilitate return of services to normal.
 The key to effective management of any incident is the rapid implementation of command and 

control management arrangements, including people and processes. This begins with the first 

responder on site, usually a manager or supervisor, who should act promptly to control the 

incident and contain the loss.
 The OCD should describe the incident organisation and operating modes other than normal 

mode, where
 the organisation is required to implement special command and control 

processes.

 TRAK metamodel as a basis for developing an OCD
 Figure 14
 illustrates 'The Railway Architecture Framework' (TRAK) metamodel, and how it would be applied as a basis for developing an OCD. TRAK is an architecture framework that sets rules to develop rail architecture mod
els. It was 
developed by the Rail Safety & Standards Board (RSSB). TRAK is based on 
AS/NZS
 ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 
Systems and software engineering 
Š Architecture description
 and derived from the 
UK Ministry of Defence Architecture 
Framework
 (MODAF).

Summary of significant accounting policies
 
 
(a)
 
Department of Transport 

 
Reporting entity
 
The 
Department of Transport
 
(the Department
 
or the parent entity
) 
is a NSW 
g
overnment entity
 
controlled b
y the NSW Total 
State Sector, which is the ultimate parent
. The 
Department
 
is a not
-
for
-
profit entity as profit is not its principal objective and it 
has no cash generating units. 
T
he parent entity has provided personnel services to Transport for NSW. 
 
 
The 
Department of Transport
 
as a reporting entity comprises all the entities under its control, namely:
 
Transport for NSW 
 
Transport Service of New South Wales 
 
Roads and Maritime Services 
 
Sydney Ferries
 
State Transit Authority
 
of NSW
 
Rail Corporation New
 
South Wales
 
Sydney Trains
 
NSW Trains
 
Residual Transport Corporation
 
 
The Department of Transport and its controlled entities are collectively referred to as the consolidated entity. 
 
 
On 1 July 2017 Residual Transport Corporation (RTC) was established under the Transport Administration Amendment 
(Transport Entities) Act 2017. Transport for NSW has determined that RTC is an entity under its control from 1 July 2017 for 
financial reportin
g purposes. The purpose of RTC is to hold, manage, operate and maintain transport assets. 
As at 30 June 
2018
, no asse
ts have been transferred to RTC
 
and there have been no transactions in this entity since it was established
.
 
 
On 1 July 2018, Sydney Metro 
was constituted as a corporation under the Transport Administration 
Amendment 
(Sydney 
Metro) Act 2018. 
Transport for NSW has determined that Sydney Metro is an entity under its control from 1 July 2018 for 
financial reporting purposes. The purpose of Sydney Metro is to deliver safe and reliable metro passenger services in an 
efficient, effective and financi
ally responsible manner; and to facilitate and carry out the orderly and efficient development of 
land in the locality of metro stations, depots and stabilising yards. 
 
 
RailCorp will progressively transition to the Transport Asset Holding Entity (TAHE). T
AHE may eventually hold additional 
public transport assets for the State, including public transport assets currently held by entit
ies controlled by the 
consolidated
 
entity
. The transfer of assets is intended to occur progressively over the next 
couple of 
years.
 
 
The Transport Administration Act 1988
 
states that the affairs of Transport for NSW are to be managed and controlled by the 
Secretary. The Secretary is defined as the Secretary of the 
Department of Transport

of
 
direction it is considered that the Department of Transport has control for the purposes of preparing consolidated financial 
statements for the above agencies and special purpose entities or divisions.
 
 
These consolidated financial statements of 
Departmen
t of Transport 
for the year ended 
30 June
 
2018
 
were authorised for 
issue by the Secretary on the date the accompanying statement was signed.
 
 
(b)
 
Principles of consolidation
 
The consolidated financial statements comprise
 
the financial statements of the parent entity and its controlled entities, after 
elimination of all inter
-
entity transactions and balances. The controlled entities are consolidated from the date the parent 
entity obtained control and unt
il such time as 
control passes.
 
 
The financial statements of the controlled entities are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent entity, using 
generally consistent accounting practices. As a result no adjustments were required for any material dissimilar acco
unting 
policies.

(c)
 
Basis of preparation
 
 
The consolidated financial statements are general purpose financial statements which have been prepared 
on an accrual 
basis and 
in accordance with:
 

 
applicable 
Australian Accounting Standards (which include Australian Accounting Interpretations);
 

 
the requirements of the Public Finance and Audit Act 1983 and 
Public Finance and Audit 
Regulation
 
2015
; and
 

 
Financial Reporting Directions 
mandated 
by the 
NSW 
Treasurer.
 
Property, plant and equipment, assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and financial assets at "fair value through profit o
r 
loss" and available for sale are measured at fair value. 
Certain bus contracts are classified as finance leases in accordance 
wi
th AASB 117 
Leases
 
and
 
all 
finance leased bus assets
 
are carried at fair value.
 
Borrowings are initially measured at the fair 
value of the consideration received and subsequently using the effective interest method. 
Other financial report items are 
prepare
d in accordance with the historical cost convention
 
except where specified otherwise
.
 
All amounts are rounded to the 
nearest one thousand dollars and are expressed in Australian currency.
 
(d)
 
Critical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions
 
 
In the application of accounting standards and Financial Reporting 
Directions mandated by the 
NSW 
Treasurer
, management 
is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
readily appar
ent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and 
various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the current set of circumstances. Actual results may differ from the
se 
estimates.
 
Management ev
aluates these judgements, estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision effects only that period or in the period of the re
vision 
and future periods if th
e revision effects both current and future periods.
 
Significant judgements, estimates and assumptions made by management in the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements are outlined below:

(e)
 
Statement of compliance 
 
 
The financial statements and notes comply with Australian Accounting Standards, which include Australian Accounting 
Interpretations.
 
 
(f)
 
Accounting for the Goods and 
Services Tax (GST) 
 
 
Income, expenses and assets are recognised net of GST, except that: 
 
 

 
the amount of GST incurred by the 
consolidated entity
 
as a purchaser that is not recoverable from the Australian 
Taxation Office is recognised as part of 

 
cost of acquisition or as part of an item of expense
;
 
and
 

 
receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included.
 
 
Cash flows are included in the S
tatement of cash flows on a gross basis.  However, the GST components of cash flows 
arising from
 
investing and financing activities which is recoverable from, or payable to, the Australian Taxation Office are 
classified as operating cash flows.

(g)
 
Business combinations
 
 
The 
consolidated entity
 
a
pplies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations.
 
The consideration transferred by the 
consolidated entity
 
to obtain control of a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the 
acquisition
-
date fair values of assets transferred and liabili
ties incurred, which includes the fair value of any asset or liability 
arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
 
The 
consolidated entity
 
recognises identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination regardless 

acquired and liabilities assumed a
re generally measured at their acquisition
-
date fair values.
 
Goodwill is stated after separate recognition of identifiable intangible assets. It is calculated as the excess of the sum of
 
(a) 
fair value of consideration transferred and (b) the recognised am
ount of any non
-
controlling interest in the acquiree, over the 
acquisition
-
date fair values of identifiable net assets. If the fair values of identifiable net assets exceed the sum calculated 
above, the excess amount (i.e. gain on a bargain purchase) is re
cognised in profit or loss immediately.
 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is not amortised. Instead, it is tested for impairment annually or more frequentl
y 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, and is carried 
at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses.
 
 
(h)
 
Comparative 
information
 
 
Except when an Australi
an Accounting Standard
 
permits or requires otherwise, comparative information is presented in 
respect of the previous period for all amounts reported in the financial statements.

-
2 Amendments to Australian Accounting 
Standards 

 
Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to AASB 107. The adoption of 
AASB 2016
-
2 resulted in additional disclosures in the notes to the financial statements. AASB 2016
-
2 amends AASB 107 
Statement of Cash Flows to require Tier 1 reporting entities to 
provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to 
evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including changes arising from cash flows and non
-
cash 
changes.
 
 
(ii)
 
New Australian Accounting Standards issued but not yet effe
ctive
 
 
Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued or revised but are not yet effective have not been early adopted 
in accordance with Treasury mandated policy. 
 
The consolidated entity is currently undertaking a
n 
assessment of the impact of
 
the following standards:
 

 
AASB 16 Leases will apply to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The standard 
introduces a new approach to lease accounting that requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for the 
rights and o
bligations created by leases. The application of this standard is expected to have a significant 
transitional impact as a result of operating leases, except 
those that are 
short term and low value leases, being 
brought onto the balance sheet.
 

 
AASB 15 Reven
ue from Contracts with Customers, including the amendments AASB 2014
-
5, AASB 2015
-
8, AASB 
2016
-
3, AASB 2016
-
7 and AASB 2016
-
8 
will apply to
 
annual reporting periods 
beginning 
on or after 1 January 2019. 
This standard is expected to impact the timing 
of 
recognition of certain revenue given the core principle of the new 
standard requires revenue to be recognised when the goods or services are transferred to the customer at the 
transaction price (as opposed to stage of completion of the transaction). 
The mo
del features a contract
-
based five
-
step analysis of transactions to determine revenue recognition.
 

 
AASB 1058 Income of Not
-
for
-
profit Entities 
will apply to
 
annual reporting periods 
beginning 
on or after 1 January 
2019. The introduction of AASB 1058 result
s in the amendment of AASB 1004 Contributions
: many of the AASB 
1004
 
requirements 
have been
 
revised and relocated to AASB 1058. The initial application of this standard is 
expected to defer the recognition of income in some circumstances.  
 

 
AASB 1059 Servi
ce Concession Arrangements: Grantors will apply to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2019. The standard requires the grantor to recognise a service concession asset, at current replacement 
cost, in a service concession arrangement wh
ere it controls the asset. A corresponding liability is also recognised 
depending on the nature of the consideration exchanged. This standard is expected to have a significant transitional 
impact as a result of 
Public Private Partnership arrangements with 
private sector operators
.

Recognition 
of assets $100.7 million (2017:
 
$34.0 million) 
includes 
the air space stratum above Wynyard Walk on Clarence 
Street 
that was recognised 
as a right of use intangible asset for the first time
 
in 2018. The asset was 
subsequently divested 
in 
October 2017 for a consideration of $49.7 million to the
 
private sector 
who acquired
 
use of the airspace for a period of 99 
years. The fair value of the asset recognised by 
the consolidated entity 
was equiva
lent to the consideration received.

Recognition and measurement
 
 
Income is recognised and measured at the fair value of the consideration or contribution received or receivable to the extent
 
that it is probable that the economic b
enefits will flow to the consolidated entity and the income can be reliably measured. 
The following specific criteria must also be met before income is recognised:
 
 
(i)
 
Parliamentary appropriations and contributions 
 
 
Parliamentary appropriations and contributions are generally recognised as income when the consolidated entity obtains 
control over the assets comprising the appropriations/contributions. Control over appropriations/contributions is normally 
obtained upon 
the receipt of cash. At the end of the financial year unspent appropriations are recognised as liabilities rather 
than income, as the authority to spend the money lapses and the unspent amount must be repaid to the Consolidated Fund 
in the next financial y
ear. The liability is disclosed under other liabilities (note 
20
).
 
 
(ii)
 
Sale of goods and services
 
 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised as reve
nue when the consolidated entity transfers the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership of the assets.
 
 
Revenue from the provision of services (including passenger transport services) is recognised as revenue when the service 
is provided or by reference 
to the stage of completion.
 
 
(iii)
 
Retained taxes, fines and fees
 
 
Retained taxes, fines and fees are recognised when the cash is received.
 
 
(iv)
 
 
Investment revenue 
 
 
Interest revenue on cash and cash equivalents and financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss are recognised in 
accordance with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. Rental revenue is recognised in 
accordance with AASB 117 Leases on a straight
-
line basis over the lease term. Royalty revenue is recognised in accordance 
wi
th AASB 118 Revenue on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement.
 
 
(v)
 
Grants and contributions receivable
 
 
Grants and contributions comprising mainly cash and in kind contributions are recognised as revenues when control pass
es 
to the consolidated entity and the contractual obligations have been satisfied. In kind contributions (e.g. roads and bridges
 
from local councils) are measured at fair value on transfer and recognised as property, plant and equipment (note
 
12
).
 
 
(vi)
 
Other revenue
 
 
Other revenue includes mainly the value of the emerging rights to receive private sector provided infrastructure. The 
non
-
cash revenue is also recognised as an asset (note 
14
).

Recognition and measurement 
 
 
Loans and receivables are non
-
derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. These financial assets ar
e recognised initially at fair value, usually based on the transaction cost. Subsequent 
measurement is at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less an allowance for any impairment of receivables. 
Any changes are recognised in the net result 
for the year when impaired, derecognised or through the amortisation process.
 
 
Short
-
term receivables with no stated interest rate are measured at the original invoice amount where the effect of 
discounting is immaterial.

Recognition and measurement  
 
 
Generally inventories are held for distribution 
(consumed in the ordinary activities of the consolidated entity). Inventories held 
for distribution are stated at cost, adjusted when applicable, for any loss of service potential. A loss of service potential
 
is 
identified and measured based on the existen
ce of a current replacement cost that is lower than the carrying amount. Costs 
are assigned to inventory using the weighted average, First
-
In
-
First
-
Out or specific identification methods depending on the 
nature of the inventory.
 
 
The cost of inventories co
mprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition.
 
 
Current replacement cost is the cost the consolidated entity would incur to acquire the asset.
 
 
Net realisable
 
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion 
and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

Transport for NSW
 
and Sydney Trains are the only grou
p entities that use derivative financial instruments. These activities 
are carried 
out in accordance with the Transport for NSW
 
and Sydney Trains Treasury Management Policies which establish 
a prudential framework covering policies, best practice, internal
 
controls and reporting systems for the management 
of 
financial risk within both Transport for 

foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, commodity risk, credit risk, use of der
ivative financial instruments and investment of 
excess funds. The reporting entities have derivative financial instruments as an asset and liability.

These p
olicies comply strictly with the internal policies and guidelines within the broad framework of the NSW 
"Treasury 
Management Policy"
 
(TPP07 7). Accounting for Treasury instruments is in accordance with NSW Treasury Accounting Policy, 
"Accounting for Financ
ial Instruments"
 
(TPP08 1). Treasury instruments approved for the management of financial risk are in 
accordance with the 
Public Authorities (Financial Arrangements) Act 1987.
 
 
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge against exposures to foreign
 
currency risk on overseas purchase 
commitments and on commodity price risk on forecast distillate and electricity purchases (where applicable).
 
 
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge against currency risk on firm commitments for the purchas
e of goods 
or services from overseas suppliers. These contracts entail a right to receive a fixed amount of foreign currency at a specif
ied 
future date, which is offset by an obligation to pay a fixed amount of domestic currency at that time.
 
 
Recognition 
and measurement 
 
 
Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss,
 
transaction costs. The consolidated entity determines the classification of its financial assets after initial 
recognition and, 
when allowed and appropriate, re
-
evaluates this at each financial year end.
 
 
Fair value through profit or loss
 
-
 
the consolidated entity subsequently measures investments classified as ''held for 
trading'' or designated upon initial recogn
ition ''at fair value through profit or loss'' at fair value. Financial assets are classified 
as ''held for trading'' if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term. Derivatives are also classified as 
held for 
trading. Gains or losses on 
these assets are recognised in the net result for the year.
 
The NSW TCorp Hour
-
Glass investment facilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss using the second leg of 
the fair value option i.e. these financial assets are managed and their p
erformance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in 
accordance with a documented risk management strategy, and information about these assets is provided internally on that 
basis to the key management personnel.
 
The movement in the fair value of the NSW TCor

-
Glass investment facilities incorporates distributions received as well 
as unrealised movements in fair value and is reported in the line item investment revenue.

time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the net result for the 
year. However, interest calculated
 
using the effective interest method and dividends are recognised in the net result for the 
year.
 
 
Purchases or sales of investments under contract that require delivery of the asset within the timeframe established by 
convention or regulation are recognis
ed on the trade date, i.e. the date the consolidated entity commits to purchase or sell 
the asset.
 
 
The fair value of investments that are traded at fair value in an active market is determined by reference to quoted current 
bid 
prices at the close of busi
ness on the Statement of financial position date.
 
 
Unquoted investment in subsidiaries incorporated as proprietary companies are stated at cost less accumulated impairment 
in the parent entity's Statement of financial position. The investment is subject to
 
at least annual reviews for impairment.

(i)
 
Impairment of financial assets 
 
 
All financial assets, except those measured at fair value through profit and loss, are subject to an 
annual review for 
impairment. An allowance for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the consolidated entity will not
 
be able to collect all amounts due.
 
 
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the allowance
 
is the difference between the asset's carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The amount of the 
impairment loss is recognised in the net result for the year.
 
 
When an available
-
for
-
s
ale financial asset is impaired, the amount of the cumulative loss is removed from equity and 
recognised in the net result for the year, based on the difference between the acquisition cost (net of any principal repayme
nt 
and amortisation) and current fair
 
value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the net result for the year.
 
 
Any reversals of impairment losses are reversed through the net result for the year, where there is objective evidence, excep
t 
reversals of impairment losses on an inve
stment in an equity instrument classified as available
-
for
-
sale must be made 
through the reserve. Reversals of impairment losses of financial assets carried at amortised cost cannot result in a carrying
 
amount that exceeds what the carrying amount would ha
ve been had there not been an impairment loss.

current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held for sale, where their carrying amount will be recovered 
principally through a sale transaction, not through continuing use.
 
 
Non
-
current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs 
to sell, in accordance with AASB 5 Non
-
Current Assets held f
or Sale and Discontinued Operations. These assets are not 
depreciated while they are classified as held for sale.

Property, plant and 

 
 
The reclassifications between property, plant and equipment classes comprise mainly 
transfer of 
land and buildings assets to 
infrastructure assets 
for Sydney Trains and RailCorp
, as well as t
ransfer of assets related to Roads and 
Maritime Services
 
major infrastructure projects.
 
 
Reclassification 
to
 
intangible assets 
mainly comprises 
the transfer of computer equipment acquired for the Next Genera
tion 
Information System project
 
for Transport for NSW and components of Roads and Mariti
me Services
 
major infrastructure 
projects.
 
 
Certain r
oads 
and rail systems 
were transferred to and from councils.
 
 
a)
 
Revaluations on land and buildings were undertaken in a number of the controlled entities in 
2018
. T
he fair value of such 
assets is
 
stated at fair value using either the direct comparison approach or 
current replacement cost (C
RC).
 
 
b)
 
Revalu
ations on 
certain 
infrastructure assets
 
including
 
roads, bridges and land and building
s
 
including those 
acquired for 
future road 
works
 
were performe
d in 
2018
.  
 
 
c)
 
All road infrastructure assets are 
stated at fair value using the C
RC approach:
 

 

Primary Approach, Secondary Approach and 
Hybrid 
Approach.
 

 
Due to the specialised nature of R
oads and 
M
aritime 
S

 

sold or traded, the fair value for this asset class cannot be determined with reference to the observable prices in 
an active market or r

determined using the valuation techniques mentioned above, primarily with reference to current tendered 
contracted rates produced by the R
oads and 
M
aritime 
S
ervices
 
Project M
anagement Office.
 

 
Land and buildings acquired for future road works, where possible, the fair value are determined by reference to 
recent market transactions, using the following methods and assumptions:
 
o
 
The pre
-
acquisition market value was used as the bas
e value for determining fair value. 
 
o
 
For land and buildings parcels purchased prior to 2000 or where pre
-
acquisition market values were not 
available, a rate per square metre was calculated from recent market transactions within the same or 
similar Local G
overnment Areas and applied to the current parcel area.
 
 
d)
 
Revaluations on buses owned by 
State Transit Authority
 
were undertaken in 2018. 
Revaluations 
on 
all owned and leased 
buses were undertaken in 201
7
 
using the C
RC approach. 
 
 
e)
 
Earthworks and tunnel bori
ng assets were
 
valued and recognised in 201
7 using the C
RC approach.
 
Valuation inputs to 
arrive at replacement cost are categorised in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and are predominantly an assessment of 
the construction costs such as materials, labour and overhead.

Recognition and measurement
 
 
(i)
 
Property, plant and equipment 
 
Property, plant and equipment comprise of land and buildings, plant and equipment (rolling stock, buses, ferries and 
general 
plant and equipment) and infrastructure systems (rail, road and maritime infrastructure including related land and buildings)
.
 
 
(ii)
 
 
Capitalisation and initial recognition 
 
Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost in accordance with
 
AASB 116 
Property, Plant and Equipment
. 
Cost is the amount of cash or cash equivalents paid or the fair value of the other consideration given to acquire the asset a
t 
the time of its acquisition or construction or, where applicable, the amount attributed 
to that asset when initially recognised in 
accordance with the requirements of other Australian Accounting Standards.
 
 
Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are initially recognised at their fair value at the date of acquisi
tion.

(ii)
 

 
 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at 
measurement d
ate.
 
 
Where payment for an asset is deferred beyond normal credit terms, its cost is the cash price equivalent, i.e. the deferred 
payment amount is effectively discounted over the period of credit.
 
 
The cost of assets constructed for own use includes the purchase cost, other directly attributable costs and the initial 
estimate of dismantling and restoration costs. Borrowing costs on qualifying assets are expensed or capitalised as per note 
2
(iv)
.
 
 
Property, plant and equipment and intangibl
e assets costing $5,000 and above individually (or forming part of a network 
costing more than $5,000) are capitalised.
 
 
(iii)
 
 
Valuation of property, plant and equipment 
 
 
Subsequent to initial recognition, property, plant and equipment are valued in accordance
 
with the 
''Valuation of Physical 
Non
-
Current Assets at Fair Value''
 
Policy and Guidelines Paper (TPP 14
-
01).  This policy adopts fair value in accordance with 
AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement
, AASB 116 
Property and
 
Plant and Equipment.
 
 
Property, plant and 
equipment is measured at the highest and best use by market participants that is physically possible, 
legally permissible and financially feasible.  The highest and best use must be available at a period that is not remote and 
take into account the charact
eristics of the asset being measured, including any socio
-
political restrictions imposed by 
government.  In most cases, after taking into account these considerations, the highest and best use is the existing use.  In
 
limited circumstances, the highest and
 
best use may be a feasible alternative use, where there are no restrictions on use or 
where there is a feasible higher restricted alternative use.
 
 

 
techniques 
(market approach, cost approach, income approach) that maximise relevant observable inputs and minimise unobservable 
inputs. Also refer to note 
15
 
for further information regarding fair value.
 
 

ndicator 
of which is current
 
replacement cost.
 
 
The 
current
 
replacement cost met
hod is used to revalue specialised buildings (designed for a specific limited purpose), 
trackwork and rail infrastructure systems, road infrastructure systems, maritime infrastructure systems, buses, ferries and 
certain 
plant and equipment. Current
 
replace


existing asset with a technologically modern equivalent asset wi
th the same economic benefits, adjusting for any overdesign, 
overcapacity and redundant components. Incremental optimisation means that optimisation is limited to the extent that 
optimisation can occur in the normal course of business using commercially av
ailable technology.
 
 
Non
-
specialised assets such as computer and office equipment with short useful lives are measured at depreciated historical 
cost, as a surrogate for fair value. This is because any difference between fair value and depreciated historic
al cost is unlikely 
to be material.

(iv)
 
Revaluation of property, plant and equipment 
 
 
The entities in the group revalue each class of property, plant and equipment at least every five years or with sufficient 
regularity to ensure that the carrying amount of each asset in the class does not differ materially from its fair value at 
reporting 
date. Revaluations are performed by independent professionally qualified valuers.
 
 
When revaluing non
-
current assets using the cost approach, the gross amount and the related accumulated depreciation are 
separately restated.
 
 
For other assets valued using 
other valuation techniques, any balances of accumulated depreciation at the revaluation date 
in respect of those assets are credited to the asset accounts to which they relate. The net asset accounts are then increased
 
or decreased by the revaluation incre
ments or decrements.
 
 
Revaluation increments are credited directly to the asset revaluation reserve, except that, to the extent that an increment 
reverses a revaluation decrement in respect of that class of asset previously recognised as an expense in the 
net result, the 
increment is recognised immediately as a gain in the net result.
 
 
Revaluation decrements are recognised immediately as a loss in the net result, except that, to the extent that a credit balan
ce 
exists in the asset revaluation reserve in res
pect of the same class of assets, they are debited directly to the asset 
revaluation reserve.
 
 
As a not
-
for
-
profit reporting entity, revaluation increments and decrements are offset against one another within a class of 
non
-
current assets, but not otherwis
e.
 
 
Where an asset that has previously been revalued is disposed of, any balance remaining in the asset revaluation reserve in 
respect of that asset is transferred to accumulated funds.
 
 
Interim revaluations are performed between comprehensive revaluations
 
where cumulative changes to indicators/indices 
suggest fair value may differ from carrying value in accordance with NSW Treasury policy and guidelines paper (TPP 14.01). 
Each entity within the group undertakes their own assessment to comprehensively reval
ue a class of assets more frequently.
 
 
(v)
 
Impairment of property, plant and equipment 
 
 
As a not
-
for
-
profit reporting entity with no cash generating units, impairment under AASB 136 Impairment of Assets is unlikely 
to arise. As property, plant and equipment 
is carried at fair value, or an amount that approximates fair value, impairment can 
only arise in the rare circumstances where the costs of disposal are material. Specifically, impairment is unlikely for the 
consolidated entity given that AASB 136 modifies
 
the recoverable amount for non
-
cash generating assets of not
-
for
-
profit 
entities to the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and depreciated replacement cost, where depreciated replacement 
cost is also fair value. This means that, for an asset alre
ady measured at fair value, impairment can only arise if costs of 
disposal are material. Costs of disposal are generally regarded as immaterial.
 
 
Notwithstanding this, the consolidated entity generally reviews the carrying values of major assets for object
ive evidence of 
impairment. Where such an indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made. An impairment loss is 
recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount unless
 
the asset has been revalued in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease. When 
the impairment subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but only to the
 

have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

(vi)
 
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment
 
 
Except for certain heritage assets, leased buses and owned buses, depreciation is provided for on a straight
-
line basis for all 
depreciable assets so as to write off the depreciable amount of eac
h asset as it is consumed over its useful life to the 
consolidated entity. 
 
 
All material separately identifiable components of assets are depreciated over their shorter useful lives. A component is 
accounted for separately if it has a useful life material
ly different from that of the prime asset and, therefore, requires 
separate replacement during the life of the prime asset; is material enough to justify separate tracking; and is capable of 
having a reliable value attributed to it. A dedicated spare part 
does not normally have a useful life of its own.
 
 
Certain heritage assets including original artworks and collections and heritage buildings may not have a limited useful life
 
because appropriate curatorial and preservation policies are adopted. The decisi
on not to recognise depreciation for these 
assets is reviewed annually. Depreciation on owned buses is calculated in line with the pattern of consumption of economic 
benefits.
 
 
Land is not a depreciable asset. Buildings which have been acquired for future 
transport infrastructure are not depreciated as 
these assets are not purchased to generate revenue and are ultimately demolished for transport infrastructure projects.  The 
expected useful lives of property, plant and equipment for depreciation purposes ar
e as follows:

Major inspection costs
 
 
When each major inspection is performed, the labour cost of performing major inspections for faults is recognised in the 
carrying amount of an asset as a replacement of a part, if the recognition criteria are satisfied. 
 
 
(viii)
 
Restoration costs 
 
 
The estimated 
cost of dismantling and removing an asset and restoring the site is included in the cost of an asset, to the 
extent it is recognised as a liability. If the effect of the time value of money is material, these costs are discounted at t
he 
appropriate market 
yields on government bonds.

Leased assets 
 
 
A distinction is made between finance leases which effectively transfer from the lessor to the lessee substantially all the r
isks 
and benefits incidental 
to ownership of the leased assets, and operating leases under which the lessor effectively retains all 
such risks and benefits.
 
 
As lessee:
 
Where a non
-
current asset is acquired by means of a finance lease, at the commencement of the lease term, the asset 
is 
recognised at its fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, at the inception of the lease. Th
e 
corresponding liability is established at the same amount.  Lease payments are allocated between the principal component 
and t
he interest expense.
 
Under the Metropolitan Bus Services, Outer Metropolitan Bus Services and Rural and Regional Bus Services contracts, 
payments to bus operators for the acquisition of new and certain existing buses are considered to be in the nature of f
inance 
leases and are recognised in accordance with AASB 117 
Leases. Leased buses were carried at historical cost up until 31 
March 2017. 
 
From 31 March 2017, the consolidated entity changed its accounting policy for the measurement of leased buses from 
hi
storical cost to fair value. The fair value accounting policy was adopted under AASB 136 Impairment of assets (paragraph 
Aus32.1 

 
32.2) in respect of not
-
for
-
profit entities where the future economic benefits of an asset are not primarily dependant 
on the
 


of the asset
 
being the best representation of its fair value. Accordingly, leased buses are now carried at fair value from 31 
March 2017 onwards. As required by AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors 
(paragraph 17) the change in accou
nting policy was accounted for as a revaluation in accordance with AASB 116 Property, 
Plant and Equipment and applied prospectively. The revaluation was accounted for based on an independent valuation of the 
entire leased bus fleet at 31 March 2017. 
 
To align with the change in accounting policy from historical cost to fair value, the depreciation method was also changed 
from straight
-
line to diminishing value which better reflects the pattern of consumption and going forward will result in a closer 
re
presentation of fair value in between valuation years. This is consistent with the requirements of AASB 116 paragraph 31 to 
ensure that the carrying value does not differ materially from what would be determined to be the fair value at the reporting
 
date. 
As part of the review of the depreciation method, the remaining useful lives and residual values of the leased buses 
were also reassessed at the revaluation date. The change in depreciation method and the reassessment of useful lives and 
residual values ar
e changes in estimates and applied prospectively from 31 March 2017. 
 
Operating lease payments are charged to the statement of comprehensive income in the periods in which they are incurred.
 
 
As lessor:
 
The consolidated entity, as the lessor, classifies it
s long term land leases (typically where the initial lease term exceeds 50 
years), as finance leases if it transfers to the lessee substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of th
e land. 
The leased assets are recognised as current and 
non
-
current receivables at amounts equal to the net investment in the 
leases.  
 
The lease receipt is recognised in two components, one as a reduction of the lease receivables and the other as a finance 
income. The finance income is calculated relevant to t
he term of the lease.

Derecognition
 
 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future economic benefits are 
expected from its use
 
or disposal. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the 
carrying amount of the asset and are included in the Statement of comprehensive income.
 
 
Where an asset that has previously been revalued is disposed of, any bala
nce remaining in the asset revaluation reserve in 
respect of that asset is transferred to accumulated funds.

Recognition and measurement  
 
 
Intangible assets are recognised only if it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the consolidated 
entity and the 
cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Intangible assets are measured initially at cost which includes the purchase pric
e 
and any costs directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use.  Where an asset is acquired at no
 
or nominal 
cost, the cost is its fair value as at the date of acquisition.
 
All research costs are expensed. Development costs are only capitalised when certain criteria are met.
 
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be finite.
 
Intangible a
ssets are subsequently measured at fair value only if there is an active market. As there is no active market for 

loss.
 
The consoli

the straight
-
line method over periods ranging from 
2 years to 19
 
years.
 
Intangible assets are tested for impairment where an indicator of 
impairment exists.  If the recoverable amount is less than its 
carrying amount the carrying amount is reduced to recoverable amount and the reduction is recognised as an impairment 
loss.

Recognition and measurement
 
 
Private sector provided infrastructure
 
 
In these private sector provided infrastructure arrangements, the grantor (the consolidated entity) gives the service 
concession in 
exchange for the right to receive the infrastructure from the operator (private sector entity) at the end of the 
concession period. The operator is required to design, finance and build the infrastructure and use it to provide services 
directly to the publ
ic during the concession period. The operator is permitted to charge the public for the services it provides. 
The service concession arrangement infrastructure is operator
-
controlled during the concession period and grantor
-
controlled 
thereafter.
 
 
In the a
bsence of a specific Australian Accounting Standard, Treasury Policy and Guidelines Paper 
Accounting for Privately 
Financed Projects
 
(TPP06
-
8) applies. This policy requires the consolidated entity to initially determine the estimated written 
down replaceme

estimated working life. The estimated written down replacement cost is then allocated on a systematic basis over the 
concession period using the annuit
y method and the government bond rate at the commencement of the project. During the 
concession period, the consolidated entity recognises the annual value of the right to receive the infrastructure as an asset
 
and as revenue (note
 
3(h)
(vi)
)
 
 
Prepaid asset
 
 
Transport for NSW has entered into PPP
 
contracts with ALTRAC Light Rail Consortium for the construction of Sydney Light 
Rail and with Northwest Rapid Transit for the construction of the Sydney Metro Northwest. The costs incurred prior to 
completion of the construction phase are recognised as a
 
prepaid asset in accordance with NSW Treasury Policy TPP 06
-
8. 
Both construction phases are expected to be completed by 2019.

Fair value measurement of non
-

 
 
(a)
 

 
 
Recognition and measurement
 
 
Fair 
value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction 
to sell th
e asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of 
a 
principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
 

licies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both 
financial and non
-
financial assets and liabilities.  When measuring fair value, the valuation technique used maximises the use 
of relevant observable inputs and minimises the use of un
observable inputs.  Under AASB 13, the consolidated entity 
categorises, for disclosure purposes, the valuation techniques based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as 
follows:
 

 
Level 1 

 
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets/liabil
ities that the entity can access at the measurement 
date.
 

 
Level 2 

 
inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly.
 

 
Level 3 

 
inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inpu
ts).
 
The consolidated entity recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period 
during which the change has occurred.
 
Refer note 
28
 
for disclosures regarding fair valu
e measurements of financial assets.
 
 
(b)
 
Valuation techniques
 
 
The 
consolidated entity
 
obtains independent valuations for its non
-
financial assets at least ever
y 5 years. For land and 
buildings (except infrastructure and land under infrastructure) independent valuations are obtained at lease every 3 years.
 
At the end of each reporting period, the 
consolidated entity
 
updates its assessment of the fair value of eac
h category of non
-
financial asset, taking into account the most recent independent valuation. The best evidence of fair value is current prices
 
in 
an active market for similar assets. Where such information is not available, the 
consolidated entity
 
considers information 
from a variety of other sources and uses specific valuation techniques including:
 

 
current prices in an active market for assets of a similar nature or recent prices of similar assets in less active markets, 
adjusted to reflect those 
differences
.
 

 
current 
replacement cost where the selling price is not available, with reference to the most appropriate modern, 
depreciated equivalent replacement asset that provides similar economic benefits, adjusted for obsolescence
.
 

 
construction costs i
ncurred by the entity
.
 

 
indexation of rates and/or fair value used in previous valuation assessments, including review of the rates against 
current market conditions and selected Australian Bureau of Statistics indexes 
applicable to the construction 
industry, to 
ensure that the carrying amount of the asset does not differ materially from the market value at the reporting date
.
 
 

 
discounted cash flow projections based on estimates of future cash flows
.
 

 
indexation of vacant land acquisition costs using L
and Property Index data provided by the Valuer General
.
 
 
 
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable inputs where available and rely as little as possible on entity or 
asset specific estimates. 
The level in the fair value hierarchy is determ
ined on the basis of the lowest level input that is 
significant to the measurement in its entirety. 
If significant inputs required to measure fair value of an
 
asset are observable, 
the asset is included in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. If one or mor
e of the significant inputs is not based on observable 
market data, the asset is included in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
 
All resulting fair value estimates for non
-
financial 
assets are included in level 3 with the exception of some land and buildi
ng, and plant and 
equipment
 
included under level 2. 
 
 
There were no changes to the valuation techniques used during the year.

-
financial assets at the end of the reporting period, at least every 5 years. 
During the 
2018
 
financial year
, a full valuation of the 
following assets was carried out by independent valuers, with the other non
-
financial assets not required to be revalued:
 

 
The fair value of land,
 
buildings
 
and owned buses
 
at State Transit Authority was valued by AssetVal Pty Ltd.
 

 
The fair value of 
road and bridge assets, certain infrastructure and land and building assets 
at Road
s
 
and Maritime 
Services
 
was valued b
y various independent valuers, internally qualified valuers and employees.
 

 
The 
fair value of ferries
 
at Sydney Ferries 
was valued by Rod
ne
y Hyman Asset Services Pty Ltd (RHAS).
 

 
The fair value of C
ountry
 
Regional Network land and building
 
assets 
at Transport for NSW 
was valued by 
Preston 
Rowe Paterson NSW Pty Ltd
.
 

 
The fair value of land owned by Rail
 
Corp
oration New South Wales
 
was valued by Opteon Property Group Pty Ltd.
 
 
In addition, independent interim valuations using indexation were carried out for the following assets:
 

 
Certain infrastructure assets
 
at Road
s
 
and Maritime Services
, and
 

 
All classes of 
assets he
ld by Sydney Trains and Rail Corporation New South Wales
.
 
 
The main level 2 and 3 inputs used are as follows:
 

 
Land and building 
-
 
acquisition cost, sale prices for comparable properties, rate per square metre of land area, land 
size, replacement b
uilding costs are determined by the external valuer and/or management, based on the most 
comparable sales evidence applicable for each property, adjusted for the specific attributes of the property being 
revalued, such as location, land use, landing values
 
applying in the locality and taking into consideration the 
implications of the applicable existing lease over the property. Indexation factors are determined based on selected 
Australian Bureau of Statistics indices applicable to the construction industry
. Construction costs incurred are 
determined by management in accordance with applicable Australian Accounting Standards. 
 

 
Plant and equipment
 

 
replacement cost for modern equivalent assets, expected useful life and remaining life of 
the assets are estima
ted and reviewed by management, based on inputs principally obtained from the manufacturer 
of the assets. 
 

 
Light rail infrastructure and rolling stock
 
-
 
replacement costs, construction project costs, length of the tracks, 
overhead power and stabling yards,
 
number of stops/stations, economic working lives of the assets, expired and 
remaining economic life, depreciation methods, residual values, indexed historical costs and gross replacements 
costs were estimated by the external valuer and/or management takin
g into consideration the physical age of the 
assets, their physical condition, repair and maintenance records, allowance for obsolescence, residual value at the 

 

 
Country rail infra
structure assets
 
-
 
replacement cost for modern equivalent assets, unit of measure for each 
asset, appropriate indexation factors, expected useful life and remaining life of the assets are estimated by the 
external valuer and/or management based on recently
 
completed transactions, projects, and current market rates 

-
site overheads and margin, 
and the location factor.
 

 
Trackwork and other rail infrastructure assets
 

 
raw 
materials and labour rates, pricing for tracks/wiring, 
construction methodology, structural foundations, and other specific allowances were estimated by the external 
valuer to establish the optimised replacement cost of each asset, taking into consideratio
n historical data, existing 
assets and current railway infrastructure technologies. Indexation factors are determined based on selected 
Australian Bureau of Statistics indices applicable to the construction industry.

are estimated by the external valuer, based on 
replacement costs of both domestic and international vehicles adjusted by an optimisation factor to reflect the 
technical and functional obsolescence and qualitative attractiveness of the fleet sub types rela
tive to the modern 
equivalent. International prices and exchange rates are adjusted for international transportation costs or structural 
modifications. Technical data and remaining life of rolling stock were confirmed by the engineering staff of Sydney 
Tra
ins and Transport for NSW. 
 

 
Road infrastructure
 
-
 
unit replacement rates for road, bridge and traffic control signal infrastructure valuation is 
carried out by suitably qualified engineering contractors and employees of Roads and Maritime Services, by 
 
ref
erence to unit prices quoted in the most recent relevant infrastructure construction tender documents, where the 
price range is adjusted to eliminate outlier amounts. The unit replacement rates are adjusted by the Road Cost Index 
as applicable. 
Components 
are depreciated over their estimated useful life depending on component type or 

 
Land under roads and within road reserves are revalued 
annually by applying the most recent urban rateable average value p
er hectare provided by the Valuer General to 
the land under roads and within reserves within each Local Government Area. 
 

 
Ferries

replacement cost, including delivery and professional fees were estimated by the external valuer
 
based on the advice of a locally

based, reputable and long
-
standing boat
-
builder, assuming the lowest cost of 
replacing the vessel with a vessel based on the agreed criteria with management. Costs incurred on major periodic 
maintenance are determined by m
anagement based on the applicable Australian Accounting Standards. 
 

 
Owned buses and finance leased buses 

 
current
 
replacement cost estimates are based on the most recent cost 
prices for the buses and current Transport for NSW Bus Procurement Panel pricing
 
for Rural and Regional Urban 
and School bus types, as quoted by numerous chassis and bus providers. 
End of life residual value, exponential 
decay curve and disposal costs were estimated by the external valuer based on the current market sales evidence 
and
 
common valuation practice for buses.

determining the replacement 
cost (fair value) of the 
underlying physical assets at 
the end of the public private 
partnership contract, 
allocating the replacement 
cost over the
 
contract period 
as the compounding value of

Recognition and measurement  
 
 
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the consolidated entity and other amounts. Payables 
are recognise
d initially at fair value, usually based on the transaction cost. Subsequent measurement is at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. Short
-
term payables with no stated interest rate are measured at the original invoice 
amount where the effect
 
of discounting is immaterial.

Recognition and measurement
 
 
Borrowings are not held for trading or designated at fair value through profit or loss. Borrowings are initially me
asured at the 
fair value of the consideration received. Any difference between the proceeds and the redemption amount (premium or 
discount) is recognised in the net result over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 
 
 
The finance lease liability is determined in accordance with AASB 117 
Leases.
 
 
Borrowings are removed from the Statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, 
cancelled or expired. The difference between the car
rying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or 
transferred to another party and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss as other income or finance costs.
 
 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the 
consolidated entity has an unconditional right to defer settlement of 
the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.

It is estimated that the provision for annual leave includes 
$45.7 million
 
(
2017
: 
$
58.2
 
million
) and long service leave includes 
$378.4 million
 
(
2017
: 
$
369.4
 
million
) that are 
expected to be paid later than 12 months.
 
 
Recognition and measurement
 
 
(i)
 
Salaries and wages, annual leave, sick leave and on
-
costs 
 
 
Liabilities for salaries and wages (including non
-
monetary benefits) and paid sick leave that are expected to be settled who
lly 
before 12 months after the reporting date are recognised and measured in respect of employees' services up to the reporting 
date at undiscounted amounts based on the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.
 
 
Annual leave is not exp
ected to be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of the annual reporting period in which 
the employees render the related service.  As such, it is required to be measured at present value in accordance with AASB 
119 Employee Benefits (although
 
short
-
cut methods are permitted).  Actuarial advice obtained by Treasury has confirmed 
that the use of a nominal approach plus the annual leave on annual leave liability (using 7.9% of the nominal value of annual
 
leave) can be used to approximate the pres
ent value of the annual leave liability.  The consolidated entity has assessed the 

immaterial to annual leave.
 
 
Unused non
-
vesting sick l
eave does not give rise to a liability as it is not considered probable that sick leave taken in the 
future will be greater than the benefits accrued in the future.
 
 
(ii)
 
Long service leave and superannuation 
 
 
A liability for long service leave is measured in accordance with AASB 119 
Employee Benefits
 
at the present value of future 
payments anticipated for the employee services that the consolidated entity has taken at the reporting date. An actuary 
calculates this using:
 
 

 
expected future wage and salary levels;
 

 
experience of employee departures; and
 

 
p
eriods of service.
 
 
Estimated future cash outflows are discounted using market yields at the reporting date that closely match the term of 
maturity of government bonds.

Long service leave a

 
 
Apart from the parent entity and some of Transport Service of New South Wales, the controlled entities are responsible for 
funding their employees' accrued long service leave entitlements which are reported under employee benefi
ts. However, in 
the case of the parent entity and some Transport Service employees, the long service leave liabilities are assumed by the 
Crown Entity and accordingly are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income as "Acceptance by the Crown Entit
y 
of employee benefits and other liabilities".
 
 
In the case of defined benefit plans (SASS, SANCSS and SSS), the net superannuation liability or asset is recognised in 
accordance with AASB 119 Employee Benefits. It is measured as the difference between the
 
present value of members' 
accrued benefits (as determined by actuaries) as at reporting date and the fair value of the superannuation scheme's assets 
at that date, determined through actuarial assessment. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised outside 
of the net result in 
the other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur. 
 
 
For those group entities that are responsible for funding their accrued superannuation liabilities, superannuation expense 
recognised in the Statement of comprehensive 
income comprises:
 
 

 
For defined contribution plans, the contribution payable for the period; and
 

 
For defined benefit plan, service cost and net interest on the net superannuation liability or asset as determined by the 
actuaries.
 
 
 
In the case of the parent
 
entity, the superannuation expense recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income 
comprises the contribution payable for the period.

benefit superannuation overview
    
 
 
This overview only relates to those e
mployees whose defined benefit superannuation schemes are not assumed by the 
Crown Entity.
 
 
Employer contributions are made to three defined
-
benefit superannuation schemes administered by the SAS Trustee 
Corporation (STC): The State Authorities Superannuat
ion Scheme (SASS), the State Authorities Non
-
Contributory 
Superannuation Scheme (SANCSS) and the State Superannuation Scheme (SSS), which together form the Pooled Fund.  
Each scheme is closed to new members and its investments are held in trust by the Pool
ed Fund.  At least a component of 
the final benefit is derived from a multiple of members' salary and years of membership.  All Fund assets are invested by 

 
 
An 
underfunded
 
scheme is
 
recognised as a provision and an overfunded scheme is recognised as an asset.  Details of both 
provisions and assets are given below.

1. The accrued liability includes a contribution tax provision.  This is calculated based on grossing up the deficit less the
 
allowance for past service expenses and insurable death and disability liabilities at a contribution tax r
ate of 15%.
 
 
2. The Future Service Liability (FSL) does not have to be recognised by an employer.  It is only used to determine if an asse
t 
ceiling limit should be imposed (AASB 119 para 64).  Under AASB 119, any prepaid superannuation asset recognised can
not 
exceed the
 
present value of any economic benefits that may be available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in 

e: 
this also in
cludes a contribution tax provision).

Nature of the benefits provided by the fund
 
 
The Pooled Fund holds in trust the investments of the closed NSW public sector superannuation schemes:
 
 
* State Authorities 
Superannuation Scheme (SASS)
 
* State Superannuation Scheme (SSS)
 
* Police Superannuation Scheme (PSS)
 
* State Authorities Non
-
contributory Superannuation Scheme (SANCS).
 
 
These schemes are all defined benefit schemes 

 
at least a component of the final ben
efit is derived from a multiple of 
member salary and years of membership. Members receive lump sum or pension benefits on retirement, death, disablement 
and withdrawal. 
 
 
All the Schemes are closed to new members.
 
 

 
Description of the regulatory framework 
 
 
The schemes in the Pooled Fund are established and governed by the following NSW legislation: Superannuation Act 1916, 
State Authorities Superannuation Act 1987, Police Regulation (Superannuation) Act 1906, State Authorities Non
-
Contributory 
Superannuatio
n Scheme Act 1987, and their associated regulations.
 
 
The schemes in the Pooled Fund are exempt public sector superannuation schemes under the Commonwealth 
Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (SIS). The SIS Legislation treats exempt public secto
r superannuation funds 
as complying funds for concessional taxation and superannuation guarantee purposes. 
 
 
Under a Heads of Government agreement, the New South Wales Government undertakes to ensure that the Pooled 
Fund 
will
 
conform with the principles of
 

reporting to members and 
that member

 
 
The New South Wales Government prudentially monitors and audits the Pooled Fund and the Trustee B
oard activities in a 
manner consistent with the prudential controls of the SIS legislation. These provisions are in addition to other legislative 

ciples of the 

 
 
An actuarial investigation of the Pooled Fund is performed every three years. The last actuarial investigation was performed 
as at 
30 June 2015
.
 
The actuary has commenced work on the 30 June 2018 
investigation. Once completed, the report will be 
available on the Fund's website.
 
 

 
Description of other entities' responsibilities for the governance of the fund 
 
 
The Fund's Trustee is responsible for the governance of the Fund. The Trustee has a legal o
bligation to act solely in the best 
interests o
f F
und beneficiaries. The Trustee has the following roles:
 
 
* Administration of the F
und and pay
ment to the beneficiaries from F
und assets when r
equired in accordance with the F
und 
rules;
 
* Ma
nagement and inve
stment of the F
und assets; and
 
* Compliance with other applicable regulations.

Description of risks 
 
 
There are a number of risks to which the Fund exposes the Employer. The more significant risks relating to the define
d 
benefits are:
 
 
* Investment risk 
-
 
The risk that investment returns will be lower than assumed and the Employer will need to increase 
contributions to offset this shortfall.
 
* Longevity risk 

 
The risk that pensioners live longer than assumed, increasing
 
future pensions.
 
* Pension indexation risk 

 
The risk that pensions will increase at a rate greater than assumed, increasing future pensions.
 
* Salary growth risk 
-
 
The risk that wages or salaries (on which future benefit amounts for active members will b
e based) will 
rise more rapidly than assumed, increasing defined benefit amounts and thereby requiring additional employer contributions.
 
* Legislative risk 
-
 
The risk is that legislative changes could be made which increase the cost of providing the defin
ed 
benefits.
 
 
The defined benefit fund assets are invested with independent fund managers and have a diversified asset mix. The Fund 
has no significant concentration of investment risk or liquidity risk.
 
 

 
Description of significant events
 
 
There were no 
fund amendments, curtailments or settlements during the year.

Derivatives, including futures and options, can be used by investment managers.  However, each manager's investment 
mandate clearly states that derivatives may only be used to facilitate efficient 
cash flow
 
management or to hedge the portfolio 
against mark
et movements and cannot be used for speculative purposes or gearing of the investment portfolio.  As such 
managers make limited use of derivatives.

Interest expense of

million (

change in the discount rate on the above provisions.
 
 
Airport Line asset replacement
 
The provision of $
4
.5
 
million (
2017
: $
5.5
 
million) recognises the contractual obligation to fund the re
newal
 
of major track and 
tunnel assets of the Airport Line by the line's maintenan
ce contractor during the term of the contractor to 2030. Any unused 
balance of the provision remaining in 2030 will be shared equally with the maintenance contractor.
 
The liability at year end is the unused portion of the contractually specified maximum su
m to be provided. The timing of 
payments 
is
 
inherently uncertain as they are based on unpredictable future claims by the maintenance contractor. This 
provision has been discounted to a present value that reflects the time value of money.
 
 
Ballast disposal
 
The provision of $1.5 million (2017: 
$
1.4 million) recognises the legal obligation in relation to the disposal of non
-
recyclable 
landfill and materials arising from ballast recycling operations. 
 
The liability was assessed at 9 April 2018 (2017: 3 April 20
17) by management after investigation of stockpiles at the 
Chullora site. The timing of the liability is uncertain due to the timing of future disposal. 
 
 
Land and buildings remediation
 
The provision of $
39.3
 
million (
2
017
: $
21.1
 
million) com
prises provisions for 
contaminated land of $34.3
 
million 
              
(2017: $13.0 million) and remedi
ation of asbestos 
contamination 
of 
$5.0
 
million (
2017
: $
8.1
 
million)
.
 
The provision for 
contaminated land includes 
$
19.0
 
million
 
(2017:
 
nil
)
 
in relation to the Parramatta Light Rail project for the clearing of industrial 
waste from 
previous 
usage
 
of certain sites
. 
The provision for remediation of 
asbestos contamination
 
relat
es to 
a program of 
hazardous materials surveys 
that commenced in 2006 
to identify the full extent of contamination and remedial action required 
in stations
, o
perational buildings 
and
 
rolling stock.
 
 
Lease make good
 
The
 
lease made good provision of $

mi
llion (
2017
: $3
5.3
 
million) recognises the consolidated entity's obligations to 
dismantle, remove and restore items of property, plant and equipment on the leased properties to its original condition at th
e 
conclusio
n of the lease. The amount of the provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present 
obligations, discounted to reflect the present value of such expenditures.

Legal and related claims
 
The
 
provision of $
3.5
 
million (
2017
: $
1.5
 
million) recognises claims against the 
consolidated entity
 
arising from legislative or 
contractual breaches or other matters. The liability at year end was assessed by managemen
t by reviewing individual claims. 
The liability is inherently uncertain due to disputes over the existence or quantum of individual claims.
 
 
Other provisions
 
Other provisions of $
37.8
 
million 
(2017: $9.8 million) 
include the
 
following:
 
 

 
$5.0 million (2017:
 
nil) 

stock currently under lease with Reliance Rail. The timing of the outflow is uncertain as the repair work is yet to be 
undertaken. The rolling stock has 
been impaired as it is currently out of service.  
 

 
$4.1 million
 
(2017: 
$
4.1 million) 
quarry 
restoration provision to recognise
 
the legal obligation to restore quarry sites 
when operations cease. The liability at year end was assessed by an independent expe
rt undertaking site 
inspections to estimate the minimum cost of the necessary restoration work. The liability is inherently uncertain due 
to the time likely to elapse before the restoration is required. 
 

 
Other provisions also include
 
compensation and
 
compliance claims, 
third party property damage, marine damage 
claims, public risk and other minor provisions. 
 
 
Recognition and measurement  
 
 
Other provisions exist when the consolidated entity has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of
 
a past event; it 
is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of th
e 
amount of the obligation.
 
 
Any provisions for restructuring are recognised only when the consolidated entity ha
s a detailed formal plan and it has raised 
a valid expectation in those affected by the restructuring that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement 
the 
plan or announcing its main features to those affected.
 
 
If the effect of the time v
alue of money is material, provisions are discounted at a rate that reflects the current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

Contingent assets and contingent liabilities 
 
 
The parent entity had no contingent liabilities as at 
30 June
 
2018
 
(
2017
: nil). Th
e 
consolidated entity
 
had contingent liabilities 
and contingent assets at 
30 June
 
2018
 
in respect of:
 
 
(i) Public Private Partnership arrangements
 
 
Sydney Trains has certain obligations under the contract for the 
rolling stock Public Private Partnership (PPP) and the 
NSW Government guarantees the performance of those obligations. However, there is no expectation that those 
guarantees will ever be exercised.
 
 
Roads and Maritime Services has certain obligations under
 
contracts with private sector parties with the performance of 
these obligations guaranteed by the NSW Government. 
The current guarantees outstanding are for the Sydney Harbour 
Tunnel, the M2 Motorway, the Eastern Distributor, the Cross
 
City Tunnel, the We
stern
 
Orbital
, 
the Lane Cove Tunnel
, 
NorthConnex and WestConnex
.
 
There is no reason to believe that these guarantees are ever to be exercised.
 
 
(ii) Litigation
 
 
Roads and Maritime Services has a number of contractual disputes with an estimated 
t
otal contin
gent liability of 
        
 
$1.8
 
million (201
7
: $
25.1
 
million).
 
Compulsory property acquisition matters under litigation have an estimated contingent 
liability of $
723.1
 
million (201
7
: $
676.2
 
million).
 
These amounts are net of Treasury Managed Fund (TMF) 
reimbursement.
 
 
There are a number of significant disputes 
which have been notified to and by Transport for NSW in relation to the Sydney 
Light Rail project. There is significant uncertainty as to the e
xtent of any future liability that will arise in respect of these 
disputes. The amount of the liability that may arise in relation to these disputes cannot be measured reliably at this time. 
 
 
 
A contractor engaged by the ALTRAC Light Rail Consortium has s
tarted proceedings in the Supreme Court of NSW against 
Transport for NSW alleging misleading or deceptive conduct. Transport for NSW denies that it engaged in any such conduct 
and is defending the proceedings. It is not possible to at this stage to estimat
e any potential financial effect from these 
proceedings.
 
 
 
After balance date, a statement of claim was filed in the Supreme Court of NSW alleging public and private nuisance as a 
result of the Sydney Light Rail project. The proceedings have been brought a
s representative proceedings. It is not possible 
to at this stage to estimate any potential financial effect from these proceedings.
 
 
 
Apart from the above matters, Transport for NSW has a number of other disputes related to property acquisitions and 
contr
actual claims subject to litigation.
 
 
The amount of the liability, if any, that may arise in relation to the majority of these 
disputes cannot be measured reliably at this time apart from $0.2 million (2017: $2.9 million) which has been quantified by 
manag
ement.

(iii) 
Letter of comfort
 
 
Transport for NSW provided a letter of comfort to the Office of Transport Safety Investigation
s
 
(OTSI) to ensure the 
ongoing financial vi
ability of OTSI during the 20
18 financial year. Transport for NSW and NSW Treasury monitor the 

 
 
(iv) Other matters
 
 
In the ordinary course of business, contractual disputes and other claims have 
been notified to and by enti
ties controlled 
by the Department. 
Further, contractual claims have arisen after the balance date relating to matters occurring during 
the financial year. 
The
 
amounts claimed are not disclosed since they are commercial in confid
ence and the 
existence or 
quantum of each claim is usually in dispute and the outcome cannot be measured reliably.
 
 
 
Certain entities controlled by the Department have environmental matters emerging from their normal operations. 
There 
is significant uncert
ainty as to whether any future liability will emerge due to the early stage of identification or works for 
many of these matters, and as such a liability cannot be accurately calculated at the date of preparation of these 
financial statements.  Where there
 
is a legal or constructive obligation to undertake remediation and the cost can be 
reliably estimated a provision is made (refer Note 19).

the transactions relating to those 
administered activities but does not have the discretion, for example, to deploy the 

 
Transactions and balances relating to the administered activities are not recognised as the cons

Restatement of infras
tructure assets
 
 
In previous years, 
the consolidated entity
 
has carried bored and excavated tunnels and earthworks in the Country Regional 
Network and bored and excavated tunnels and earthworks entering service prior to 30 June 2000 in RailCorp at nil value on 
the basis that the assets could not
 
be reliably m
easur
ed. In 2017, the consolidated entity
 
valued these assets using advances 
in technology, improved asset management systems, equipment and technical asset information. On balance, it now appears 
it may have been possible to reliably value these assets in a pr
ior year. 
As a result, the consolidated en
t
ity
 
recorded an 
additional $971.1 million in tunnel boring assets and $7,532.4 million in earthworks to correct the value of infrastructure 
assets as at 1 July 2016 with an adjustment to equity. The nature of the 
inputs to the valuation makes it impractical to 
retrospectively restate previously reported balances.

Financial i
nstruments
 
 
The 
consolidated entity

reporting entities operations or are required to finance the 
consolidated entity

 
 
The 
consolidated entity
 
does not enter into trade fin
ancial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for 
speculative purposes. Derivatives are exclusively used for hedging purposes.
 
 
The operational activities of the 
consolidated entity
 
expose it to a variety of financial risks: credit risk, 
liquidity risk and market 
risk (including interest rate risk currency risk, and commodity price risk in respect of distillate and electricity purchases
). The 
main risks arising from these financial instruments are outlined below together with the 
consolida
ted entity

policies and processes for measuring and managing risk.
 
 
Methods used to measure risk include sensitivity analysis in the case of interest rate, foreign exchange and other commodity 
price risks, and an ageing analysis for credit ri
sk. Further quantitative and qualitative disclosures are included throughout 
these financial statements.
 
 
The Secretary and each of the Chief Executives of the controlled entities have overall responsibility for the establishment a
nd 
oversight of risk mana
gement and review and determine policies for managing each of these risks. Risk management 
policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the 
consolidated entity
, to set limits and to monitor risks. 
Compliance with these policies is re
viewed by the Audit and Risk Committee and internal audit on a regular basis.

(a)
 

 
 
Recognition and measurement
: de
-
recognition of financial 
assets and liabilities
 
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire; or if the 
consolidated entity transfers the financial asset:
 
 

 
where substantially all the risks and rewards have been t
ransferred or 
 

 
where the consolidated entity has not transferred substantially all the risks and rewards, if the consolidated entity has not
 
retained control.
 
 
Where the consolidated entity has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks a
nd rewards or transferred 
control, the asset is recognised to the extent of the consolidated entity's continuing involvement in the asset.
 
 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or ex
pires.
 
 
(b)
 
Derivatives
 
 
The 
consolidated entity
 
only uses derivatives for hedging purposes and not as trading or speculative instruments. 
 
 
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to mitigate exchange rate exposure arising from firm commitments for the 
purchase of goods and services in foreign currency. Forward foreign exchange and commodity swap contracts are used to 
hedge against commodity price risk on forecast purchase
s
 
of distillate
 
and electricity
. 
 
 
All forward foreign exchange have been designate
d as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges in accordance with AASB 
139 Financial Instruments
: Recognition and Measurement
. The gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instruments at fair 
value is recognised in other comprehensive income and deferred in
 
equity in the hedging reserve, to the extent that the 
hedge is effective. There was no hedge ineffectiveness in the current year. 
 
 
As at 
30 
June 2018, the only commodity swap contract
 
held by the consolidated entity 
was an economic hedge
 
to manage 
exposure to electricity price risk under the approved risk management policies. This derivative is
 
not designated in a hedge 
relationship under AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement
. It 
is categorised as held for trading
 
an
d 
classified in the Statement of financial position as a cash flow hedge. 
 
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that 
are not designated in a hedge relationship are recognised immediately in profit or loss as part of gain/(loss) in fair value
 
of 
financial instruments. 
  
 
 
The 
consolidated entity
 
held $
5
.4
 
million (
2017
: $
0.4
 
million) in de
rivative financial assets and $
2.2 
million (

in derivative financial liabilities. 
The parent did not have any derivative financial assets or liabilities (201

.
 
 
The following table indicates the periods in which the cash flow associated with cash flow hedges are expected to occur and

All derivatives are measured at fair value. Information about the 
exposure to credit risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity risk 
the methods and assumptions used in determining fair values of derivatives is provided in note

Credit risk
 
 
Credit 
r
isk arises where a debtor or counterparty does not complete their obligations, resulting in financial risk to the 
consolidated entity
.
 
 
Credit risk can arise from financial assets of the 
consolidated entity
, including cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial 
instruments, deposits with banks and NSW TCorp, as well as credit exposure to customers, including outstanding receivables 
and committed transactions. The 
consolidated entity
 
holds bank guarantees
 
for significant customers as well as property 
bonds for some leased premises. The 
consolidated entity
 
has not granted any financial guarantees.
 
 
Credit risk policy is aimed at minimising the potential for counter party default.
 
 
Credit risk associated wit
h the 
consolidated entity

selection of counterparties and establishment of minimum credit rating standards. All debt management and investment 
activities are undertaken with NSW TCorp
, which is guaranteed by the NSW Government.
 
 
Credit risk impacts on the following financial instruments which are discussed below:
 
 
Cash
 
Cash comprises cash on hand and bank balances within the NSW Treasury Banking System. Interest is earned on daily bank
 
balances at the 
prevailing RBA cash
 
rate, adjusted for a management fee to NSW Treasury.
 
 
Receivables 

 
trade debtors
 
All trade debtors are recognised as amounts receivable at balance date. Collectability of trade debtors is reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. 

including letters of demand. Debts which are known to be uncollectible are written off. An allowance for impairment is raised
 
when there is objective evide
nce that the 
consolidated entity
 
will not be able to collect all amounts due. This evidence 
includes past experience, and current and expected changes in economic conditions and debtor credit ratings. No interest is 
earned on trade debtors. Sales are gener
ally made on 30 day terms.
 
 
The 
consolidated entity
 
is not materially exposed to concentrations of credit risk to a single trade debtor or group of debtors. 
Based on past experience, debtors that are not past due $
10.7
 
million (
2017
: $
13.1
 
million); parent entity nil (
2017
: nil)) and 
not more than 3 months overdue $
31.3
 
million (
2017
: $
32.9
 
million); parent enti
ty nil (
2017

generally 
considered 
impaired. These debtors represent 
71.4
% (
2017
: 
72.2
%) of the total trade debtors.

The parent did not have any financial assets that are past due or impaired
 
(

Derivatives 
 
Transport for NSW
 
and Sydney Trains have undertaken both 
forward exchange currency swaps and commodity swaps. The 
risks associated with these arrangements are mitigated by only entering into arrangements with reputable, well established 
financial institutions with high level credit ratings.
 
 
Other financial asse
ts
 
The repayment of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel loan ranks behind all creditors to be paid. Redemption of the M2 and Eastern 
Distributor promissory notes is dependent upon counterparties generating sufficient cash flows to enable the face value to be
 
repaid.
 
 
(d)
 
Liquidity risk
 
 
Liquidity r
isk is the risk that the 
consolidated entity
 
will be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due. The 
consolidated entity
 
continuously manages risk through monitoring future cash flows and maturities planning to ensure 
adequate holding of high quality liquid assets. The objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and 
flexibility through the use of overdr
afts, loans and other advances.
 
 
The 
consolidated entity
 
has access to credit facilities with NSW TCorp of $
3,714.2
 
million (
2017

(e)
 
Market risk
 
 
Market risk relates to fluctuations in the fair value of future cash flows of financial instruments because of changes in mar
ket prices. 
This applies to the 
consolidated entity

 
 
Sen
sitivity analysis on market risk is based on a reasonably possible price variability taking into account the economic environ
ment 
in which the 
consolidated entity
 
operates and the time frame for assessment, that is, until the end of the next reporting peri
od. The 
sensitivity analysis is based on financial instruments held at the balance date. The analysis assumes that all other variable
s remain 
constant.
 
 
The effect on the net result
 
and equity due to a reasonably possible change in risk variable is outline
d in the information provided 
below, for interest rate risk and other price risk including currency movements. A reasonably possible change in risk variabl
e has 
been determined after taking into account the economic environment in which the 
consolidated en
tity
 
operates and the time frame 
for the assessment (i.e. until the end of the next annual reporting period). The sensitivity analysis is based on risk exposu
res in 
existence at the balance date. The analysis is performed on the same basis as for 
2017
 
and assumes that all other variables 
remain constant.
 
 
The 
consolidated entity
 
is exposed to market risks in respect of:
 
 
(i) Interest rate risk
 
 
 
Exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily through the 
consolidated 
entity

undertaking mainly fixed rate borrowings, primarily with NSW Treasury Corporation (NSW TCorp).

(ii) Foreign exchange risk
 
 
Exposure to foreign exchange risk arises primarily through the contractual commercial transactions denominated in a foreign 
currency. The risk is measured using sensitivity analysis and cash flow forecasting. 
 
 
The 
consolidated entity
 
manages its foreign e
xchange risk by entering into forward exchange contracts in accordance with each 

 
 
Foreign exchange risk related to the principal amount of overseas purchase commitments made, that are primarily dominated in 
E
uros, 
US dollars and Pound
s
 
Sterling, have been fully hedged using forward contracts that mature on the same dates as the 
forecast purchase are due for payment. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. 
 
 
The 
consolidated entity

foreign exchange risk is set out in the table below, with all other variables being held 
constant. All underlying exposure and related hedges are taken into account. The impact on other comprehensive income is due 
to 
changes in the fair value of the financ
ial instruments. The impact on equity is due to changes in the fair value of forward exchange 
contracts designated as cash flow hedge
s
. 
 
 
A sensitivity of 10% movement in the exchange rates has been selected for use in the sensitivity analysis at the 
reporting date, as 
this is considered reasonable, based on the current Australian dollar level and the historical volatility of the Australian d
ollar against 
other currencies. Based on the value of the Australian dollar at the reporting date as compared wi
th the currencies below, adverse 
or favourable movements in the foreign exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in the Australian dollar fair v
alue 
respectively.

(iii) Commodity price risk
 
 
The 
consolidated entity
 
is exposed to a range of commodity price risks, principally from distillate and electricity purchases. 
 
 
Australian dollar costs under the supply agreements price mechanism for distillate are reflective of movements in Singapore G
as 
Oil prices and AUD/USD
 
exchange rates. The 
consolidated entity
 
hedges its distillate exposure by entering into Singapore Gas Oil 
swap and US Dollar forward contracts.
 
The
se distillate
 
swap contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.
 
 
The consolidated 
 
entity is exposed to ele
ctricity price risk associated with the purchase of electricity to operate to operate transport 
services. The exposure to fluctuations in wholesale market prices is managed by entering into fixed price supply arrangements
 
with 
retailers or to hedge forec
as

 
energy load. Generally, electricity swap contracts 
are designated as cash flow hedges. However as at 30 June 2018, the only electricity derivative f
inancial instrument was
 
not 
designated in a hedge relat
ionship under AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.  
This derivative is 
categorised as held for trading and classified in the Statement of financial position as a cash flow hedge.
 
 
 
 
The 
consolidated entity

ice risk is set out in the table below, with all other variables being held constant. 
All underlying exposure and related hedges are taken into account. The impact on other comprehensive income is due to changes
 
in the fair value of the financial instrumen
ts. The impact on equity is due to changes in the fair value of commodity swap contracts 
designated as cash flow hedge. 
 
 
A sensitivity of 10% movement in the spot price
 
of the respective commodities
 
has been selected for use in the sensitivity analysis 
at the reporting date.

The unit price of each facility is equal to 
the total fair value of the net assets held by the facility divided by the total number of units 
on issue for that facility. Unit prices are calculated and published daily.
 
 
NSW TCorp is the trustee for each of the above facilities and is required to act i
n the best interest of the unit holders and to 
administer the trusts in accordance with the trust deeds. As trustee, NSW TCorp has appointed external managers to manage the
 
performance and risks of each facility in accordance with a mandate agreed by the p
arties. However, NSW TCorp acts as manager 
for part of the Cash Facility. A significant portion of the administration of the facilities is outsourced to an external cus
todian.
 
 
Investment in the Hour
-
Glass facilities limits the 
consolidated entity

re to risk, as it allows diversification across a pool of 
funds with different investment horizons and a mix of investments.
 
 
NSW TCorp provides sensitivity analys
is information for each of the i
nvestment facilities, using historically based volatility 
informa
tion. The NSW TCorp Hour
-
Glass i
nvestment facilities are designated at fair value through profit and loss and, therefore, 
any change in unit price impacts directly on net result (rather than equity). A reasonably possible change is based on the 
perc
entage change in unit price (as advised by NSW TCorp) multiplied by the redemption value as at 
30 June
 
each year.
 
 
The impact on the net result as a result of changes in the unit prices of the investments is not considered to be material.

Fair value compared to carrying amount
 
 
Financial instruments are generally recognised at cost, with the exception of the TCorp Hour
-
Glass facilities and derivatives, which 
are measured at fair value. 
 
 
The amortised cost of all othe

instruments recognised in the S

because of the short

term nature of many of the financial instruments, with the exception of TCorp borrowings.

The 
consolidated 
entity uses the following hierarchy for disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: 
 

 
Level 1 
-
 
Derived from quoted prices in 
active markets for
 
identical assets/
liabilities. 
 

 
Level 2 
-
 
Derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable directly or indirectly. 
 

 
Level 3 
-
 
Derived from valuation techniques that
 
include inputs for the asset/
liability not based on 
observable market data 
(unobservable inputs)
.
 
 
 
The 
consolidated entity 
has assessed the fair value of its financial instruments on the basis of inputs other than quoted prices that 
are observed directly or indirectly (Level 2). 
 
 
The fair
 
value of the 
TCorp Hour
-
Glass i
nvestments is based on the entity's share of the value of the underlying assets of the 
facility, based on the market value. All of the Hour
-
Glass facilities are valued using redemption pricing. 
 
 
The fair value of forward foreign exchange
 
contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the reporting date. 
 
 
The fair value of commodity swap contracts is determined using market prices at the reporting date. 
 
 
There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 during the year. 
 
 
There we
re no changes in the valuation techniques during the year.

Recognition and measurement
 
 
Equity tra
nsfers represent the transfer of net assets between agencies as a result of an administrative restructure, transfers of 
programs/functions and parts thereof between NSW public sector agencies and "equity appropriations". These equity transfers a
re 
designat
ed or required by Accounting Standards to be treated as contributions by owners and recognised as an adjustment to 
"Accumulated Funds". This treatment is consistent with NSW Treasury Policy and Guidelines Paper Accounting Policy: 
Contributions by owners ma
de to wholly
-
owned Public Sector Entities (TPP 09
-
03), AASB 1004 Contributions and Australian 
Interpretation 1038 Contributions by Owners made to Wholly
-
owned Public Sector Entities.
 
 
Transfers arising from an administrative restructure involving not
-
for
-
p
rofit and for
-
profit government entities are recognised at the 
amount at which the assets and liabilities were recognised by the transferor immediately prior to the restructure. Subject to
 
below, 
in most instances this will approximate fair value.
 
 
All oth
er equity transfers are recognised at fair value, except for intangibles. Where an intangible has been recognised at 
(amortised) cost by the transferor because there is no active market, the transferee agency recognises the asset at the trans
feror's 
carryi
ng amount. Where the transferor is prohibited from recognising internally generated intangibles, the transferee agency does 
not recognise that asset.

(b)
 
Asset revaluation reserve
 
 
The asset revaluation reserve is used to record 
increments and decrements on the revaluation of non
-
current assets. This accords 

12 (recognition and 
measurement 
(iii) and (iv)
)
.
 
(c)
 
Hedge reserve
 
 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is reco
gnised in 
other comprehensive income and is accumulated in the hedge reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion 
is 

nised in 
other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged 
item is 
recognised in profit or loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item.
 
(d)
 
Accumulated funds 
 
 
The category "accumulated funds" includes all current and prior period retained funds.
 
(e)
 
Other reserves
 
 
Separate reserve accounts are recognised in the
 
financial statements only if such accounts are required by specific legislation or 
Australian Accounting Standards.
 
(f)
 
Contributed capital
 
 
In accordance with TPP 09
-
03, the transfer of cash from NSW Treasury to fund capital construction of major rail projec
ts is treated 
as an equity contribution.

ment that provides a guarantee of up to $500.0 million against a borrowing 
facility provided by some of the private sector debt providers to ALTRAC Light Rail Consortium (ALTRAC), which is currently 

cility has three tranches totalling $500.0 million. The first tranche of 
$100.0 million was advanced by those lenders to ALTRAC on 3 July 2018. The second tranche of $100.0 million has been made 
available to be drawn down by ALTRAC from 20 September 2018 o

inancial position of Transport for NSW as a result of providing this 
guarantee. The extent to which the guarantee may be called upon 
will depend on a number of factors, including the ultimate 
resolution of various disputes between Transport for NSW and ALT
RAC.

Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 30 June

 Summary of significant accounting policies 
 (a) Transport for NSW - Reporting entity 
 
Transport for NSW was established on 1 November 201
1 as a not for profit statutory authority (as profi
t is not its principal 
objective) and it has no cash generating units. Its
 roles include planning, procurement, delivery and 
coordination of transport 
services and infrastructure in NSW.  

 
The 
Transport Administration Act 1988
 states that the affairs of Transport for NSW are t
o be managed and controlled by the 
Secretary of the Department of Transport. Consistent
 with the Secretary™s power of direction it is consi
dered that Transport 
for NSW has control for the purposes of preparing c
onsolidated financial statements for the following 
agencies and special 
purpose entities or divisions: 

 
 - Roads and Maritime Services 

 - Sydney Ferries  

 - State Transit Authority 

 - Rail Corporation New South Wales 

 - Sydney Trains  

 - NSW Trains  

 -Transport Service of New South Wales 

 
On 1 July 2017 Residual Transport Corporation (RTC)
 was established under the 
Transport Administration Amendment 
(Transport Entities) Act 2017
. Transport for NSW has determined that RTC is an e
ntity under its control from 1 July 2017 for 
financial reporting purposes. The purpose of RTC is
 to hold, manage, operate and maintain transport as
sets.  
 
On 1 July 2018 Sydney Metro was constituted as a cor
poration under the 
Transport Administration Amendment (Sydney
 Metro) Act 2018
. Transport for NSW has determined that Sydney Metro
 is an entity under its control from 1 July 2018 fo
r 
financial reporting purposes. The purpose of Sydney 
Metro is to deliver safe and reliable metro passeng
er services in an 
efficient, effective and financially responsible ma
nner; and to facilitate and carry out the orderly a
nd efficient development of 
land in the locality of metro stations, depots and 
stabling yards.  
 
Transport for NSW, a controlled entity of the Depar
tment of Transport, has received an exemption from 
NSW Treasury from 
preparing consolidated financial statements on the 
basis that the Department of Transport, as the pare
nt entity of Transport 
for NSW, produces consolidated financial statements
. These financial statements are for the Transport 
for NSW parent entity 
only.  

 
Rail Corporation New South Wales (RailCorp) will pro
gressively transition to the Transport Asset Holding
 Entity (TAHE). 
TAHE may eventually hold additional public transport 
assets for the State, including public transport ass
ets currently held by 
Transport for NSW. The transfer of assets is intend
ed to occur progressively over the next few years. 
 
Transport for NSW is consolidated as part of the NS
W Total State Sector Accounts, which is the ultimate 
parent. The 
financial statements of Transport for NSW for the y
ear ended 30 June 2018 were authorised for issue by
 the Secretary on 
the date the accompanying Statement was signed. 

 
 (b) Basis of preparation 
 The financial statements are general purpose financ
ial statements which have been prepared on an accru
al basis and in 
accordance with: 
· applicable Australian Accounting Standards (which inc
lude Australian Accounting Interpretations);  
· the requirements of the 
Public Finance and Audit Act 1983
 and the 
Public Finance and Audit Regulation 2015
; and  
· Financial Reporting Directions mandated by the NSW 
Treasurer.

 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont™d
) 
 
(b)       Basis of preparation (cont™d) 
 
Property, plant and equipment, investment property, 
assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and finan
cial assets at ﬁfair 
value through profit or lossﬂ and available for sal
e are measured at fair value. Certain bus contracts
 are classified as finance 
leases in accordance with AASB 117 Leases and all finan
ce leased bus assets are carried at fair value from
 31 March 2017. 
Borrowings are initially measured at the fair value 
of the consideration received and subsequently usin
g the effective interest 
method. Other financial report items are prepared i
n accordance with historical cost convention except
 where specified 
otherwise. 

  

All amounts are rounded to the nearest one thousand 
dollars and are expressed in Australian currency 
 (c)       Critical accounting estimates, judgement 
and assumptions 
 In the application of accounting standards and the 
Financial Reporting Directions mandated by the NSW 
Treasurer, 
management is required to make judgements, estimate
s and assumptions about the carrying values of asse
ts and liabilities 
that are not readily apparent from other sources. T
he estimates and associated assumptions are based o
n historical 
experience and various factors that are believed to
 be reasonable under the current set of circumstanc
es. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates. 

  

Management evaluates these judgements, estimates an
d assumptions on an ongoing basis. Revisions to est
imates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is r
evised, if the revision affects only that period, o
r in the period of the 
revision and future periods if the revision affects
 both current and future periods. 
  

The judgements, key assumptions and estimates manag
ement has made are disclosed in the relevant notes 
to the financial 
statements. 

 (d)      Statement of compliance 
 
The financial statements and notes comply with Austr
alian Accounting Standards, which include Australian 
Accounting 
Interpretations. 
   (e)      Accounting for the Goods and Services Tax (
GST) 
 Income, expenses and assets are recognised net of t
he amount of GST, except that: 
· the amount of GST incurred by Transport for NSW as 
a purchaser that is not recoverable from the Austral
ian 
Taxation Office is recognised as part of an asset™s
 cost of acquisition or as part of an item of expen
se; and  
· receivables and payables are stated with the amoun
t of GST included. 
 
Cash flows are included in the Statement of cash flo
ws on a gross basis. However, the GST components of
 cash flows 
arising from investing and financing activities whi
ch is recoverable from, or payable to, the Australia
n Taxation Office are 
classified as operating cash flows. 

 (f)      Comparative information 
 
Except when an Australian Accounting Standard permit
s or requires otherwise, comparative information is
 presented in 
respect of the previous period for all amounts repo
rted in the financial statements.

      Summary of significant accounting policies (c
ont™d) 
 (g)      Changes in accounting policy, including ne
w or revised Australian Accounting Standards 
 (i) Effective for the first time in 2018 
 
The accounting policies applied in 2018 are consist
ent with those of the previous financial year with 
the exception of AASB 
2016-2 
Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards Œ Disc
losure Initiative: Amendments to AASB 107.
  
 
The adoption of AASB 2016-2 resulted in additional disc
losures in the notes to the financial statements. AASB
 2016-2 
amends AASB 107 
Statement of Cash Flows
 to require Tier 1 reporting entities to provide di
sclosures that enable users of 
financial statements to evaluate changes in liabili
ties arising from financing activities, including c
hanges arising from cash 
flows and no-cash changes. 

 (ii) New Australian Accounting Standards issued but 
not yet effective 
 
Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations th
at have been issued or revised but are not yet effe
ctive have not been 
early adopted in accordance with Treasury mandated 
policy. 
 
AASB 16 
Leases
 will apply to annual reporting periods beginning o
n or after 1 January 2019. The standard introduces 
a new 
approach to lease accounting that requires a lessee
 to recognise assets and liabilities for the rights
 and obligations created 
by leases. Transport for NSW is currently undertaki
ng a detailed assessment of the impact of AASB 16. The 
application of 
this standard is expected to have a significant tra
nsitional impact as a result of operating leases, e
xcept those that are short 
term and low value, being brought onto balance shee
t.  
 
AASB 15 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, including the amendments AASB 2014-5, AASB 2015-8, AASB 2016-
3, 
AASB 2016-7 and AASB 2016-8 has application from annual rep
orting periods on or after 1 January 2019. This sta
ndard 
impacts the timing of recognition of certain revenu
e given the core principle of the new standard requ
ires revenue to be 
recognised when the goods or services are transferr
ed to the customer at the transaction price (as opp
osed to stage of 
completion of the transaction). Transport for NSW i
s currently undertaking a detailed assessment of th
e impact of AASB 15 
but at this stage is not anticipating a significant
 transitional impact. 
 
AASB 1058 
Income of Not-for-profit Entities
  has application from annual reporting periods on 
or after 1 January 2019. The 
introduction of AASB 1058 results in the amendment of AAS
B 1004 
Contributions
 with many of its requirements being 
revised and relocated to AASB 1058. This standard can r
esult in deferring the recognition of income in som
e circumstances. 
Transport for NSW is currently undertaking a detail
ed assessment of the impact of AASB 1058 but at this st
age is not 
anticipating a significant transitional impact. 

 
AASB 1059 
Service Concession Arrangements: Grantors
 will apply to annual reporting periods beginning o
n or after 1 
January 2019. The standard requires the grantor to 
recognise a service concession asset, at current re
placement cost, in a 
service concession arrangement where it controls th
e asset. A corresponding liability is also recognise
d depending on the 
nature of the consideration exchanged. Transport fo
r NSW is currently undertaking a detailed assessmen
t of the impact of 
AASB 1059. At this stage, this standard is expected to h
ave a significant transitional impact as a result o
f the Public Private 
Partnership arrangement with a private sector operat
or. 
 
The impact of the following standards in the period
 of initial application is not expected be signific
ant.

Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 30 June

2.      Expenses excluding losses (cont™d) 
 Recognition and measurement 

 (i) Personnel services expenses 

 Transport for NSW cannot directly employ staff. The
 personnel services are provided by the Transport S
ervice of New South 
Wales and the Department of Transport. As a result,
 Transport for NSW reports personnel service expens
es, not employee 
related expenses. Personnel service expenses include
 salaries, wages, leave entitlements, superannuatio
n, workers™ 
compensation insurance premium, payroll tax, fringe
 benefits tax and redundancies. 
 
Some personnel service expenses are included in the 
construction costs of intangible assets and rail in
frastructure systems 
and are, therefore, not included in the personnel s
ervice expenses. 
 (ii) Other operating expenses 

 Other operating expenses generally represent the da
y-to-day running costs incurred in the normal opera
tions of Transport for 
NSW.  

   (iii)      Insurance 
 Transport for NSW arranges insurance cover through 
the NSW Treasury Managed Fund Scheme apart from cou
ntry rail 
infrastructure cover which is arranged through priv
ate insurance providers. The cost of insurance is e
xpensed in the period to 
which the insurance cover relates
. 
  (iv)     Operating leases 
  
An operating lease is a lease other than a finance l
ease. Operating lease payments are recognised as an
 operating expense 
in the Statement of comprehensive income on a straig
ht-line basis over the lease term. 
   (v)     Major rail project expenses 
 Transport for NSW manages the design and constructi
on of major rail projects on behalf of RailCorp.  F
rom 1 July 2015, 
RailCorp receives a direct equity injection from th
e Crown Entity to fund its contract activities with 
Transport for NSW. Under 
this funding arrangement, RailCorp reimburses Trans
port for NSW for construction costs incurred on a m
onthly basis. The  
arrangement is considered to be in the nature of co
nstruction contracts and is recognised in accordanc
e with AASB 111 
Construction Contracts
. These expenses are recovered through major rail p
roject revenue. 
 (vi)    Maintenance 
 There is no maintenance costs included in personnel
 related expenses. 
 (vii) Grants and subsidies 
 Grants and subsidies generally comprise contributio
ns in cash or in kind to transport services provide
rs and various local 
government authorities and not-for-profit community
 organisations. 
 (viii) Finance costs 
 Finance costs comprise mainly interest on borrowing
s and finance lease interest charges. In accordance
 with Treasury™s 
mandate for the not-for-profit general government s
ector agencies, finance costs are expensed and reco
gnised in the 
Statement of comprehensive income in the period in w

 Transport for NSW recognised the air space stratum 
above Wynyard Walk on Clarence Street as a right of
 use intangible 
asset for the first time and subsequently divested 
the asset by entering into a contract with the priv
ate sector in October 
2017. As the result, the private sector paid Transp
ort for NSW a consideration of $49.7 million who ac
quired the use of the 
airspace for a period of 99 years. The fair value o
f the asset recognised by Transport for NSW was equ
ivalent to the 
consideration received. 

 
 Recognition and measurement 

 Income is recognised and measured at the fair value
 of the consideration or contribution received or r
eceivable to the extent 
that it is probable that the economic benefit will 
flow to Transport for NSW and the income can be rel
iably measured. 
Comments regarding the accounting policies for the 
recognition of income are discussed below. 
 (i) Parliamentary appropriations and contributions 
 Parliamentary appropriations and contributions from 
other bodies (including grants and contributions) a
re generally 
recognised as income when Transport for NSW obtains
 control over the assets comprising the appropriati
ons/contributions. 
Control over appropriations/contributions is normal
ly obtained upon the receipt of cash. At year end un
spent appropriations 
are recognised as liabilities rather than income, a
s the authority to spend the money lapses and the u
nspent amount must be 
repaid to the Consolidated Fund. Any liability is di
sclosed in Note 18 as part of ﬁOther liabilitiesﬂ. 
The amount will be repaid 
and the liability will be extinguished in the next 
financial year. Please refer to Summary of compliance
 with financial 
directives. 

 (ii)      Sale of goods 

 Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised as rev
enue when Transport for NSW transfers the significa
nt risks and 
rewards of ownership of the assets.

 (iii)        Rendering of services 

 Revenue from the provision of services (including p
assenger transport services) is recognised as reven

is provided or by reference to the stage of complet
ion. 
  (iv)      Investment income 
 Interest income on cash and cash equivalents is rec
ognised using the effective interest method as set 
out AASB 139 
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement
. Rental income is recognised in accordance with AASB 1
17 
Leases
 on 
a straight line basis over the lease term. Royalty 
income is recognised in accordance with AASB 118 
Revenue
 on an accrual 
basis in accordance with the substance of the relev
ant agreement. 
 (v)     Shared and corporate services revenue 
 Shared and corporate services revenue represents rev
enue for the provision of shared and other corporat
e services to 
various transport operating entities and is recogni
sed when the service is provided.   
 (vi)    Grants and contributions 
 Income from grants (other than contribution by owne
rs) is recognised when Transport for NSW obtains co
ntrol over the 
contribution. Transport for NSW is deemed to have a
ssumed control when the grant is received or receiv
able. 
Contributions are recognised at their fair value. C
ontributions of services are recognised when and on
ly when a fair value of 
those services can be reliably determined and the s
ervices would be purchased if not donated. 
 (vii)   Major rail project revenue 

 Major rail project revenue is recognised in the Stat
ement of comprehensive income in proportion to the 
stage of completion 
of these RailCorp funded construction activities at
 the reporting date. The value of work performed is
 measured at the value 
of the progressive costs incurred during the report
ing period for each project. Major rail project exp
ense is recognised in the 
Statement of comprehensive income as incurred.  Amou
nts due from RailCorp for these rail projects are d
isclosed as an 
asset, and the amounts due to RailCorp are disclose
d as a liability

Recognition and measurement 

 Receivables, including trade receivables, prepaymen
ts etc. are non-derivative financial assets with fi
xed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market. R
eceivables are initially recognised at fair value p
lus any directly 
attributable transactions costs. Susequent measureme
nt is at amortised cost using the effective interes
t method, less any 
impairment. Changes are recognised in the net resul
t for the year when impaired, derecognised or throu
gh the amortisation 
process. Short-term receivables with no stated inter
est rate are measured at the original invoice amoun
t where the effect of 
discounting is immaterial.

Recognition and measurement 

 Transport for NSW holds derivative financial instru
ments to hedge its foreign currency risk exposure a
rising from overseas 
purchase commitments and manage its exposure to who
lesale energy prices arising from commitments to pu
rchase 
renewable energy.  Derivatives are carried as finan
cial assets when the fair value is positive and as 
financial liabilities when 
the fair value is negative. Embedded derivatives ar
e separated from the host contract and accounted fo
r separately if certain 
criteria are met.  

 (i) Foreign exchange derivatives Œ cash flow hedges
  
Specific accounting treatment is required for deriva
tives designated as hedging instruments in cash flo
w hedge relationships. 
To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relati
onship must meet several strict conditions with res
pect to documentation,  
probability of occurrence of the hedged transaction
 and hedge effectiveness. All other derivative fina
ncial instruments are 
accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
  
At the inception of a hedge relationship, Transport 
for NSW formally designates and documents the hedge
 relationship, to 
which Transport for NSW wishes to apply hedge accou
nting. Such hedges are expected to be highly effecti
ve in achieving 
offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and 
are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that 
they actually have 
been highly effective throughout the financial repo
rting periods for which they were designated.  
 
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are cla
ssified as:  
· Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to cha
nges in the fair value of a recognised asset or lia
bility or an 
unrecognised firm commitment; 
· Cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to vari
ability in cash flows that is either attributable t
o a particular risk 
associated with a recognised asset or liability or 
a highly probable forecast transaction or the forei
gn currency risk in an 
unrecognised firm commitment; 
· Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
  
Transport for NSW has designated its forward curren
cy contracts as cash flow hedges. The effective por
tion of the gain or 
loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in oth
er comprehensive income and included within the cas
h flow hedge 
reserve in equity, while any ineffective portion is
 recognised immediately in profit or loss.

 Financial assets at fair value (cont™d) 
 Recognition and measurement (cont™d) 
 (i) Foreign exchange derivatives Œ cash flow hedges
 (cont™d) 
 
At the time the hedged item affects profit or loss, 
any gain or loss previously recognised in other com
prehensive income is 
transferred from equity to profit or loss and prese
nted as a reclassification adjustment within other 
comprehensive income. 
However, if the hedged item is the cost of a non-fi
nancial asset or liability, the gains and losses pr
eviously recognised in 
other comprehensive income are included in the init
ial measurement of the hedged item.  
 
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, termi
nated or exercised without replacement or rollover 
(as part of the hedging 
strategy), or if its designation as a hedge is revo
ked, or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria
 for hedge accounting or 
hedge accounting is discontinued, any cumulative ga
in or loss previously recognised in other comprehen
sive income 
remains separately in equity until the forecast tra
nsaction occurs. However, if the forecast transacti
on is no longer expected 
to occur, the cumulated gain or loss in equity is t
ransferred to profit or loss. 
 (ii) Energy derivative Œ cash flow hedge 
 Transport for NSW has entered into an energy deriva
tive for economic hedging purposes under the approv
ed risk 
management policies, which is not designated in a h
edge relationship hedge 
under AASB139 Financial instruments
: 
Recognition and Measurement. 
The derivative is categorised as held for trading a
nd classified in the Statement of financial 
position as cash flow hedge. Changes in the fair va
lue of derivative instruments that are not designat
ed in a hedge 
relationship are recognised immediately in profit o
r loss as part of gain/(loss) in fair value of fina
ncial instruments. 
 (iii) Impairment of financial assets  
 All financial assets, except those measured at fair 
value through profit and loss, are subject to an an
nual review for 
impairment. An allowance for impairment is establis
hed when there is objective evidence that Transport
 for NSW will not be 
able to collect all amounts due. 

 
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the
 amount of the allowance is the difference between 
the asset™s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future ca
sh flows, discounted at the effective interest rate
. The amount of the 
impairment loss is recognised in the net result for
 the period. 
 
When an available for sale financial asset is impai
red, the amount of the cumulative loss is removed f
rom equity and 
recognised in the net result for the period, based 
on the difference between the acquisition cost (net
 of any principal 
repayment and amortisation) and current fair value,
 less any impairment loss previously recognised in 
the net result for the

Any reversals of impairment losses are reversed thro
ugh the net result for the period, where there is o
bjective evidence, 
except reversals of impairment losses on an investm
ent in an equity instrument classified as available
 - for - sale must be  
made through the reserve. Reversals of impairment l
osses of financial assets carried at amortised cost
 cannot result in a 
carrying amount that exceeds what the carrying amou
nt would have been had there not been an impairment

Transport for NSW provides repayable interest-free 
advances to assist taxi operators (in rural and reg
ional NSW) to make 
their taxis wheel-chair accessible. Transport for N
SW holds bills of sale as security for these advanc
es and has recorded its 
financial interests in the vehicles in the Register
 of Encumbered vehicles. 
 
Refer to Note 26 for further information regarding 
credit risk, liquidity risk, and market risk arisin
g from financial instruments 
and Note 9 for information on the impairment of fin
ancial assets. 
 Recognition and measurement 

 Investments in other financial assets are initially
 recognised at fair value plus, in the case of inve
stments not at fair value 
through profit and loss, transaction costs. Transpo
rt for NSW determines the classification of its fin
ancial assets on initial 
recognition and, when allowed and appropriate, re-e
valuates this at each financial year end. 
 (i) Fair value through profit and loss 
 Transport for NSW subsequently measures investments
 classified as ﬁheld for tradingﬂ or designated upo
n initial recognition 
ﬁat fair value through profit and lossﬂ at fair val
ue. Financial assets are classified as ﬁheld for tr
adingﬂ if they are acquired for 
the purpose of selling in the near term. Derivative
s are also classified as held for trading. Gains or
 losses on these assets are 
recognised in the net result for the period. 

 (ii) Held-to-maturity investments 
 Non derivative financial investments with fixed or 
determinable payments and fixed maturity that Trans
port for NSW has the 
positive intention and ability to hold to maturity 
are classified as ﬁheld to maturityﬂ. These investm
ents are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate me
thod. Changes are recognised in the net result for 
the period when 
impaired, derecognised or through the amortisation 
process. 
 (iii) Available-for-sale investments 
 Any residual investments that do not fall into any o
ther category are accounted for as available-for-sa
le investments and 
measured at fair value in other comprehensive incom
e until disposed or impaired, at which time the cum
ulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income
 is recognised in the net result for the period. Ho
wever, interest 
calculated using the effective interest method and 
dividends are recognised in the net result for the 
period. 
Purchases or sales of investments under contract tha
t require delivery of the asset within the timefram
e established by 
convention or regulation are recognised on the trad
e date, i.e. the date Transport for NSW commits to 
purchase or sell the 
asset.

Within Rail Systems adjustments have been made to t
he gross carrying value ($13.3 billion) and accumul
ated depreciation ($13.3 billion) without any chang
e to the net carrying amount as reported at June 
2017 

 2As disclosed in Note 11(x), from 31 March 2017 Tran
sport for NSW changed its accounting policy for the
 measurement of leased buses from historical cost t
o fair value. For further details refer to Note 14(
e). 
 
In 2015 Transport for NSW entered into a Public Pri
vate Partnership (PPP) with Northwest Rapid Transit
 for the construction of the Sydney Metro Northwest
 (SMN), formerly the North West Rail Link (NWRL). 
The SMN project includes improvement to the Epping 
to Chatswood Rail Link (ECRL), extending from Chats
wood to the North Western suburbs of Sydney. The EC
RL improvement assets are brought to account 
as the costs incurred under the PPP in line with NS
W Treasury Policy TPP06-8. The ECRL is a component 
of SMN assets. The PPP will operate until 2034.

Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 30 June

Property, plant and equipment (cont™d) 
 
Recognition and measurement  

 Property, plant and equipment comprise land and buil
dings, plant and equipment (general plant and equip
ment and finance 
lease assets) and infrastructure systems. 

 (i) Capitalisation and initial recognition  
 
The cost method of accounting is used for the initi
al recording of all acquisitions of assets controll
ed by Transport for NSW in 
accordance with AASB 116 
Property, Plant and Equipment
. Cost is the amount of cash or cash equivalents pa
id or the fair 
value of the other consideration given to acquire t
he asset at the time of its acquisition or construc
tion or, where applicable, 
the amount attributed to that asset when initially 
recognised in accordance with the requirements of o
ther Australian 
Accounting Standards. 

  

Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal considera
tion, are initially recognised at their fair value 
at the date of acquisition. 
  

Fair value is the price that would be received to s
ell an asset in an orderly transaction between mark
et participants at 
measurement date. 

  

Where payment for an asset is deferred beyond norma
l credit terms, its cost is the cash price equivale
nt, i.e. deferred 
payment amount is effectively discounted over the p
eriod of credit. 
  

The cost of assets constructed for own use includes
 the purchase cost, other directly attributable cos
ts and the initial 
estimates of dismantling and restoration costs. 

 (ii) Capitalisation thresholds 
 Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
costing $5,000 and above individually (or forming p
art of a network 
costing more than $5,000) are capitalised. 

 (iii) Valuation of property, plant and equipment 
 Subsequent to initial recognition, property, plant a
nd equipment assets are valued in accordance with t
he ﬁValuation of 
Physical Non Œ Current Assets at Fair Valueﬂ Policy and
 Guidelines paper (TPP 14-01). This policy adopts fai
r value in 
accordance with AASB 13 
Fair Value Measurement 
and
 AASB 116 
Property, Plant and Equipment. 
  

Property, plant and equipment is measured at the hig
hest and best use by market participants that is ph
ysically possible, 
legally permissible and financially feasible. The h
ighest and best use must be available at a period t
hat is not remote and 
take into account the characteristics of the asset 
being measured, including any socio-political restr
ictions imposed by 
government.  In most cases, after taking into accou
nt these considerations, the highest and best use i
s the existing use. In 
limited circumstances, the highest and best use may
 be a feasible alternative use, where there are no 
restrictions on use or 
where there is a feasible higher restricted alterna
tive use.

 Recognition and measurement (cont™d) 
 (iv) Revaluation of property, plant and equipment 
 Fair value of property, plant and equipment is base
d on a market participants™ perspective, using valu
ation techniques 
(market approach, cost approach, income approach) t
hat maximise relevant observable inputs and minimis
e unobservable 
inputs.  Refer to Note 11 and Note 14 for further i
nformation regarding fair value. 
 
Where there is no available market evidence, the as
set™s fair value is measured at its market buying p
rice, the best indicator 
of which is current replacement cost. 

 
The current replacement cost is used to revalue spe
cialised buildings (designed for a specific limited
 purpose), infrastructure 
systems and certain plant and equipment. Current re
placement cost for these types of assets is based o
n ﬁincremental 
optimised replacement costﬂ. Optimised replacement 
cost is the minimum cost, in the normal course of b
usiness, to replace 
the existing asset with a technologically modern eq
uivalent asset with the same economic benefits, adj
usting for any 
overdesign, overcapacity and redundant components. 
Incremental optimisation is limited to the extent t
hat optimisation can 
occur in the normal course of business with commerc
ially available technology. 
  

Transport for NSW revalues land and buildings at le
ast once every three years and each other class of 
property, plant and 
equipment at least every five years or with suffici
ent regularity to ensure that the carrying amount o
f each asset in the class 
does not differ materially from its fair value at r
eporting date. Transport for NSW revalues infrastru
cture systems asset class 
on a rolling basis. Revaluations are performed by i
ndependent professionally qualified valuers. 
  

The last comprehensive revaluation of property, pla
nt and equipment was summarised as follows: 
 Asset Type    Last comprehensive revaluation date 

 Land and buildings   31 March 2018  
 Light rail infrastructure   30 June 2014 

 Country regional network infrastructure  31 March 
2017 
 Finance leased buses   31 March 2017 

 
Non-specialised assets with short useful lives are 
measured at depreciated historical cost, as an appr
oximation of fair value. 
This is because any difference between fair value a
nd depreciated historical cost is unlikely to be ma
terial. 
 
Interim revaluations are performed between comprehe
nsive revaluations where cumulative changes to indi
cators/indices 
suggest fair value may differ materially from carry
ing value. Generally, an interim management revalua
tion is performed if the 
cumulative changes in indicators/indices are less t
han 20%. An interim formal revaluation is performed 
by external 
professionally qualified valuers when the cumulativ
e changes in indicators/indices exceed 20%. Managem
ent will assess 
whether comprehensive revaluations are required mor
e frequently if the interim revaluations indicate m
ovements are 
generally more than 20%. 

 
When revaluing non-current assets using the cost ap
proach, the gross amount and the related accumulate
d depreciation are 
separately restated. 

  

For other assets valued using other valuation techn
iques, any balances of accumulated depreciation at 
the revaluation date 
in respect of those assets are credited to the asse
t accounts to which they relate. The net asset acco
unts are then increased 
or decreased by the revaluation increments or decre
ments.

for the year ended 30 June

Property, plant and equipment (cont™d) 
 Recognition and measurement (cont™d) 
 (iv) Revaluation of property, plant and equipment (
cont™d) 
 Revaluation increments are credited directly to the
 asset revaluation surplus, except that, to the ext
ent that an increment 
reverses a revaluation decrement in respect of that
 class of asset previously recognised as an expense
 in the net result, the 
increment is recognised immediately as a gain in th
e net result. Revaluation decrements are recognised
 immediately as a 
loss in the net result, except that, to the extent 
that a credit balance exists in the asset revaluati
on surplus in respect of the 
same class of assets, they are debited directly to 
the asset revaluation surplus. 
 
As a not-for-profit reporting entity, revaluation in
crements and decrements are offset against one anot
her within a class of 
non-current assets, but not otherwise. 

 
Where an asset that has previously been revalued is
 disposed of, any balance remaining in the asset re
valuation surplus in 
respect of that asset is transferred to accumulated
 funds. 
 (v) Impairment of property, plant and equipment 
 As a not-for-profit reporting entity with no cash ge
nerating units, impairment under AASB 136 
Impairment of Assets 
is unlikely 
to arise.  As property, plant and equipment is carri
ed at fair value or an amount that approximates fai
r value, impairment can 
only arise in the rare circumstances where the cost
s of disposal are material.  Specifically, impairmen
t is unlikely for 
Transport for NSW given that AASB 136 modifies the reco
verable amount test for non-cash generating assets 
of not-for-profit 
entities to the higher of fair value less costs of 
disposal and current replacement cost, where curren
t replacement cost is also 
fair value. This means that, for an asset already m
easured at fair value, impairment can only arise if
 selling costs are 
material. Selling costs are regarded as immaterial. 

 
Notwithstanding this, Transport for NSW generally r
eviews the carrying values of major assets for obje
ctive evidence of 
impairment. Where such an indication exists, an est
imate of the recoverable amount is made. An impairme
nt loss is 
recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income 
when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its re
coverable 
amount unless the asset has been revalued in which 
case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluatio
n decrease. When 
the impairment subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset is increased to the revised est
imate of its 
recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the
 asset™s carrying amount does not exceed the carryi
ng amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation or amorti
sation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. 
 (vi) Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 
 Depreciation is provided for on a straight-line bas
is for all depreciable assets so as to write off th
e depreciable amount of 
each asset as it is consumed over its useful life t
o Transport for NSW except for leased buses, which 
are depreciated on a 
diminishing value basis.  

  

Land is not a depreciable asset. Buildings which hav
e been acquired for future transport infrastructure
 are not depreciated as 
these assets are not purchased to generate revenue 
and are ultimately demolished for transport infrast
ructure projects. The 
expected useful lives of property, plant and equipm
ent for depreciation purposes are as follows: 
 Asset Class   Useful Lives 
 Buildings   25 - 80 years 
 Infrastructure systems  20 - 197 years 

 Plant and equipment  3 - 25 years 

 Finance leased buses  15 - 25 years 

 Rolling stock   25 years 
Buses   20 Œ 25 years 

Ferries   35 - 40 years

Property, plant and equipment (cont™d) 
 Recognition and measurement (cont™d) 

 (vi) Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 
(cont™d) 
 The asset residual values, useful life and deprecia
tion methods are reviewed, and adjusted, if appropr
iate, at each financial 
year end. Changes in the expected useful life or th
e expected pattern of consumption of future economi
c benefits embodied 
in assets are considered to modify the depreciation
 period or method, as appropriate, and are treated 
as changes in 
accounting estimates and adjusted prospectively. 

 (vii) Major inspection costs 
 When each major inspection is performed, the labour
 cost of performing major inspections for faults is
 recognised in the 
carrying amount of an asset as a replacement of a p
art, if the recognition criteria are satisfied. 
 (viii) Restoration costs  
 The estimated cost of dismantling and removing an a
sset and restoring the site is included in the cost
 of an asset, to the 
extent it is recognised as a liability. If the effe
ct of the time value of money is material, these co
sts are discounted at the 
appropriate market yields on government bonds. 
 (ix) Maintenance  
 Day-to-day servicing costs or maintenance are charg
ed as expenses as incurred, except where they relat
e to the 
replacement of a part or a component of an asset, i
n which case the costs are capitalised and deprecia
ted. 
 (x) Leased assets  
 A distinction is made between finance leases which e
ffectively transfer from the lessor to the lessee s
ubstantially all the risks 
and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased 
assets, and operating leases under which the lessor
 does not transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards. 

 
Where a non-current asset is acquired by means of a
 finance lease, at the commencement of the lease te
rm, the asset is 
recognised at its fair value or if lower, the prese
nt value of the minimum lease payments, at the ince
ption of the lease. The 
corresponding liability is established at the same 
amount. Lease payments are allocated between the pr
incipal component 
and the interest expense. 

 
Under the Sydney Metropolitan Bus Services Contracts,
 Outer Sydney Metropolitan Bus Services Contracts and
 Rural and 
Regional Bus Service Contracts, payments to bus opera
tors for the acquisition of new buses and certain e
xisting buses are 
considered to be in the nature of finance leases an
d are recognised in accordance with AASB 117 Leases. L
eased buses 
were carried at historical cost up until 31 March 2
017.  
 
From 31 March 2017, Transport for NSW changed its a
ccounting policy for the measurement of leased buse
s from historical 
cost to fair value. The fair value accounting polic
y was adopted under AASB 136 (para. Aus32.1-32.2) in re
spect of not-for-
profit entities where the future economic benefits 
of an asset are not primarily dependent on the asse
t™s ability to generate net 
cash inflows and where the entity would, if deprive
d of the asset, replace its remaining future econom
ic benefits. Therefore 
the asset™s recoverable amount is determined based 
on the current replacement cost of the asset being 
the best 
representation of its fair value. Accordingly, lease
d buses are now carried at fair value from 31 March
 2017 onwards. As 
required by AASB 108 (para. 17) the change in accountin
g policy was accounted for as a revaluation in acco
rdance with 
AASB 116 and processed prospectively. The revaluation w
as accounted for based on an independent valuation 
of the entire 
leased bus fleet as at 31 March 2017.

 (x) Leased assets (cont™d) 
 
To align with the change in accounting policy from 
historical cost to fair value, the depreciation met
hod was also changed 
from straight-line to diminishing value which bette
r reflects the pattern of consumption and going for
ward will result in a closer 
representation of fair value in between valuation y
ears. This is also therefore consistent with the re
quirements of paragraph 
31 of AASB 116 to ensure that the carrying value does n
ot differ materially from what would be determined 
to be the fair 
value at the reporting date. As part of the review o
f the depreciation method, the remaining useful liv
es and residual values of 
the leased buses were also reassessed at the revalu
ation date. The change in depreciation method and t
he reassessment of 
useful lives and residual values are changes in est
imates and therefore were processed prospectively f
rom 31 March 2017.  
 
Operating lease payments are charged to the Statemen
t of comprehensive income in the periods in which t
hey are incurred. 
 (xi)  Derecognition 
 An item of property, plant and equipment is derecogn
ised upon disposal or when no further future econom
ic benefits are 
expected from its use or disposal.  Gains and losse
s on disposal are determined by comparing the proce
eds with the carrying 
amount of the asset and are included in the Stateme
nt of comprehensive income.

 Intangible assets (cont™d) 
 
Recognition and measurement 

 Intangible assets are recognised only if it is prob
able that future economic benefits will flow to Tra
nsport for NSW and the 
cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Intangi
ble assets are measured initially at cost which inc
ludes the purchase price 
and any costs directly attributable to preparing th
e asset for its intended use.  Where an asset is ac
quired at no or nominal 
cost, the cost is its fair value as at the date of 
acquisition. 
 
All research costs are expensed. Development costs a
re only capitalised when certain criteria are met i
n accordance with 
AASB 138
 Intangible Assets
. 
 
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed 
to be finite. 
  

Intangible assets are subsequently measured at fair
 value only if there is an active market. As there i
s no active market for 
Transport for NSW™s intangible assets, the assets a
re carried at cost less any accumulated amortisatio
n and impairment 
losses. 
 Transport for NSW™s intangible assets of: 
· Information technology systems which are amortised
 using the straight line methods ranging from 5 to 
18 years.  
· Right of use assets include right of use of land a
nd airspace acquired from third party land owners. 
The right of use 
of land acquired for the construction of the CBD Lig
ht Rail was amortised using straight line method fo
r the 
remaining period of the construction and operation 
phases of the project (16 to 19 years). 
 Intangible assets are tested for impairment where a
n indicator of impairment exists. If the recoverabl
e amount is less than its 
carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to 
recoverable amount and the reduction is recognised 
as an impairment 
loss.

 Fair value measurement of non-financial assets 
 Fair value measurement and hierarchy 

 Fair value is the price that would be received to s
ell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fa
ir value measurement is based on the presumption th
at the transaction 
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes p
lace either in the principal market for the asset o
r liability or in the absence of a 
principal market, in the most advantageous market f
or the asset or liability. 
 
A number of Transport for NSW™s accounting policies 
and disclosures require the measurement of fair val
ues, for both 
financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
  When measuring fair value, the valuation techniqu
e used maximises the use 
of relevant observable inputs and minimises the use
 of unobservable inputs.  Under AASB 13, Transport for 
NSW 
categorises, for disclosure purposes, the valuation
 techniques based on the inputs used in the valuati
on techniques as 
follows: 

Level 1 Œ quoted prices in active markets for ident
ical assets / liabilities that Transport for NSW ca
n access at the 
measurement date. 

Level 2 Œ inputs other than quoted prices included 
within Level 1 that are observable, either directly
 or indirectly. 
Level 3 Œ inputs that are not based on observable m
arket data (unobservable inputs). 
 
Transport for NSW recognises transfers between leve
ls of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the re
porting period during 
which the change has occurred.

 (b) Valuation process 
 Transport for NSW obtains independent valuations fo
r its land and buildings assets at least every 3 ye
ars and for its other 
non-financial assets at least every 5 years. 

 
Transport for NSW engages external professionally q
ualified valuers to determine the fair value of the
 entity™s non-financial 
assets. A comprehensive valuation of Country Regiona
l Network land and buildings were conducted by Prest
on Rowe 
Paterson NSW Pty Ltd for 31 March 2018. A comprehensiv
e valuation of the country regional network infrast
ructure assets 
was conducted by E3 Advisory for 31 March 2017. A comp
rehensive valuation of the finance leased buses was
 conducted by 
RHAS for 31 March 2017. A comprehensive valuation of t
he Inner West Light Rail assets was performed in 20
14. Pitcher 
Partners was engaged to conduct an interim valuation
 of the Inner West Light Rail assets as at 31 March
 2017 using 
indexation. The majority of plant and equipment are
 measured using depreciated historical cost as an a
pproximation of fair 
value and do not require fair value hierarchy discl
osure. 
 (c)    Valuation techniques and input 
 
At the end of each reporting period, Transport for N
SW updates its assessment of the fair value of each
 category of non-
financial asset, taking into account the most recen
t independent valuation. The best evidence of fair 
value is current prices in 
an active market for similar assets. Where such inf
ormation is not available, Transport for NSW consid
ers information from a 
variety of other sources and uses specific valuatio
n techniques including: 
 · current prices in an active market for assets of a
 similar nature or recent prices of similar assets 
in less active 
markets, adjusted to reflect those differences;  
· current replacement cost where the selling price i
s not available, with reference to most appropriate
 modern, 
depreciated equivalent replacement asset that provi
des similar economic benefits;  
· construction costs incurred by the entity;

These valuation techniques maximise the use of obse
rvable inputs where available and rely as little as
 possible on entity or 
asset specific estimates. The level in the fair val
ue hierarchy is determined on the basis of the lowe
st level input that is 
significant to the measurement in its entirety. If 
significant inputs required to measure fair value o
f an asset are observable, 
the asset is included in level 2 of the fair value 
hierarchy. If one or more of the significant inputs
 is not based on observable 
market data, the asset is included in level 3 of th
e fair value hierarchy. All resulting fair value est
imates for non-financial 
assets are included in level 3. 
 
There were no changes to the valuation techniques u
sed during the year. 
 
The main inputs used for level 3 fair value measure
ments are as follows: 
 · Land and building 
Œ acquisition cost, sale prices for comparable prop
erties, land size are determined by the 
external valuer and/or management, based on the mos
t comparable sales evidence applicable for each pro
perty, 
adjusted for the specific attributes of the propert
y being revalued, such as location, land use and la
nding values 
applying in the locality. Construction costs incurr
ed and expected useful life of the assets are deter
mined and 
reviewed by management in accordance with applicabl
e Australian Accounting Standards.
 · Plant and equipment 
Œ replacement cost for modern equivalent assets, ex
pected useful life and remaining life of 
the assets are estimated and reviewed by management
, based on inputs principally obtained from the man
ufacturer 
of the assets.
 · Country rail infrastructure assets 
Œ replacement cost for modern equivalent assets, un
it of measure for each 
asset, appropriate indexation factors, expected use
ful life and remaining life of the assets are estim
ated by the 
external valuer and/or management based on recently
 completed transactions, projects, and current mark
et rates 
where available, with allowances for demolition of 
the existing property, contractor™s off-site overhe
ads and margin, 
and the location factor.
 · Light rail infrastructure and rolling stock 
Œ replacement costs for the Pyrmont Light Rail netw
ork assets, 
construction costs for the Inner West Light Rail ex
tension network assets, length of the tracks, overh
ead power and 
stabling yards, number of stops/stations, economic 
working lives of the assets, expired and remaining 
economic life, 
depreciation methods, residual values, indexed hist
orical costs and gross replacements costs were esti
mated by the 
external valuer and/or management taking into consi
deration the physical age of the assets, their phys
ical condition, 
repair and maintenance records, allowance for obsol
escence, residual value at the end of the asset™s e
conomic life, 
and construction project budget/forecast.
  
· Non-current Asset held for sale 
Œ rate per square meter of gross floor area, land s
ize, estimated sale costs, 
valuation decline factor, market trading value per 
gaming machine entitlements and permits, and develo
pment costs 
incurred are determined by the external valuer and/
or management, based on the most comparable sales e
vidence 
applicable for each parcel of land adjusted for spe
cific factor attributable to the asset and market c
ondition.
  
· Leasehold improvement make good 
Œ restoration costs on the leased property estimate
d on the rate per square 
metre basis were discounted, adjusted for inflation
 and depreciated over the remaining lease period.
 · Finance leased buses 
Œ Optimised Replacement Cost (ORC) is the minimum t
hat it would cost, in the normal 
course of business, to replace the existing asset w
ith a technologically modern equivalent new asset w
ith the same 
economic benefits, allowing for any differences in 
the quantity and quality of input and in operating 
costs. The ORC 
estimates are based on the most recent cost prices 
for the buses and current Transport for NSW Bus Pro
curement 
Panel pricing for Rural and Regional Urban and Scho
ol bus types, as quoted by numerous chassis and bus
 
providers.

 These amounts represent liabilities for goods and s
ervices provided to Transport for NSW and other amo
unts. Payables are 
recognised initially at fair value, usually based o
n the transaction cost. Subsequent measurement is a
t amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. Short-term payables 
with no stated interest rate are measured at the or
iginal invoice amount 
where the effect of discounting is immaterial. 
 Details regarding credit risk, liquidity risk and m
arket risk, including a maturity analysis of the ab
ove payables, are disclosed 
in Note 26.

 Recognition and measurement 

 Borrowings are not held for trading or designated a
t fair value through profit or loss. Borrowings are
 initially measured at the 
fair value of the consideration received and are re
cognised at amortised cost using the effective inte
rest rate method. Gains 
or losses are recognised in the net result for the 
year on de-recognition. 
  

The finance lease liability is determined in accord
ance with AASB 117
 Leases
. 
  

Borrowings are removed from the Statement of financ
ial position when the obligation specified in the c
ontract is discharged, 
cancelled or expired. The difference between the ca
rrying amount of a financial liability that has bee
n extinguished or 
transferred to another party and the consideration 
paid is recognised in profit or loss as other incom
e or finance costs. 
 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities un
less the reporting entity has an unconditional righ
t to deter settlement of the 
liability for at least 12 months after the reportin
g date. 
 Financial guarantees 

 A financial guarantee contract is a contract that r
equires the issuer to make specified payments to re
imburse the holder for a 
loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to 
make payment when due in accordance with the origin
al or modified terms of 
a debt instrument. 

 
Financial guarantee contracts are regonised as a li
ability at the time the guarantee is issued and ini
tially recognised at fair 
value plus, in the case of financial guarantees not
 at fair value through profit or loss, directly att
ributable transaction costs, 
where material. After initial recognition, the liab
ility is measured at the higher of the amount deter
mined in accordance with 
AASB137 and the amount initially recognised, less a
ccumulated amortisation, where appropriate. 
 
Transport for NSW has reviewed its financial guaran
tee and determined that there is no material liabil
ity to be recognised for 
financial guarantee contracts as at 30 June 2018 an
d as at 30 June 2017. However, refer to Note 24 reg
arding disclosures 
on contingent liabilities.

 Recognition and measurement 

 Other provisions exist when Transport for NSW has a
 present legal or constructive obligation as a resu
lt of a past event; it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be requi
red to settle the obligation; and a reliable estima
te can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. 

  

Any provisions for restructuring are recognised onl
y when Transport for NSW has a detailed formal plan
 and it has raised a 
valid expectation in those affected by the restruct
uring by starting to implement the plan or announci
ng its main features to 
those affected. 

 
If the effect of the time value of money is materia
l, provisions are discounted at a rate that reflect
s the current market 
assessments of the time value of money and risk spe
cific to the liability. 
 
The land and buildings remediation provision is rec
ognised when TfNSW has a legal or constructive obli
gation to remediate 
contaminated property. The make good provision is r
ecognised when TfNSW has an obligation to restore p
roperty to its 
original condition, for example at the end of a lea
se. The value recognised for each provision represe
nts the most reliable 
basis for estimating the outflow of resources requi
red to settle the obligations

 Equity and reserves (cont™d) 
 Recognition and measurement 
 Equity transfers represent the transfer of net asset
s / liabilities between agencies as a result of an 
administrative restructure, 
transfers of programs / functions and parts thereof
 between NSW public sector agencies and "equity app
ropriations". These 
equity transfers are designated or required by Accou
nting Standards to be treated as contributions by ow
ners and recognised 
as an adjustment to "Accumulated funds". This treatm
ent is consistent with NSW Treasury Policy and Guide
lines Paper 
Accounting Policy: 
Contribution by owners made to wholly-owned public 
sector entities
 (TPP 09-03), AASB 1004
 Contributions
 and Australian
 Interpretation 1038
 Contributions by Owners made to Wholly-owned Publi
c Sector Entities
.  
 
Transfers arising from an administrative restructur
e involving not-for-profit and for-profit governmen
t entities are recognised 
at the amount at which the assets and liabilities w
ere recognised by the transferor immediately prior 
to the restructure. 
Subject to below, in most instances this will approx
imate fair value. 
 All other equity transfers are recognised at fair va
lue, except for intangibles. Where an intangible ha
s been recognised at 
(amortised) cost by the transferor because there is
 no active market, the agency recognises the asset 
at the transferor™s 
carrying amount. Where the transferor is prohibited
 from recognising internally generated intangibles,
 the transferee agencies 
does not recognise that asset. 

 
 
 Contingent liabilities and contingent assets  
 There are a number of significant disputes which ha
ve been notified to and by Transport for NSW in rel
ation to the Sydney 
Light Rail project. There is significant uncertaint
y as to the extent of any future liability that wil
l arise in respect of these 
disputes. The amount of the liability that may aris
e in relation to these disputes cannot be measured 
reliably at this time. 
   A contractor engaged by the ALTRAC Light Rail Consort
ium has started proceedings in the Supreme Court of 
NSW against 
Transport for NSW alleging misleading or deceptive 
conduct. Transport for NSW denies that it engaged i
n any such conduct 
and is defending the proceedings. It is not possibl
e at this stage to estimate any potential financial
 effect from these 
proceedings.
   After balance date, a statement of claim was filed i
n the Supreme Court of NSW alleging public and priva
te nuisance as a 
result of the Sydney Light Rail project. The proceed
ings have been brought as representative proceeding
s. It is not possible 
at this stage to estimate any potential financial e
ffect from these proceedings.
   Apart from the above matters, there are a number of 
other disputes related to property acquisitions and
 contractual claims 
subject to litigation.  The amount of the liability
, if any, that may arise in relation to the majorit
y of these disputes cannot be 
measured reliably at this time apart from $0.2 mill
ion (2017: $2.9 million) which has been quantified 
by management.
   Transport for NSW provided a letter of comfort to t
he Office of Transport Safety Investigation (OTSI) to
 ensure the ongoing 
financial viability for a period of at least twelve
 months from the date when the 2017-18 audit report
 for OTSI is signed. 
Transport for NSW and NSW Treasury monitor the fina
ncial performance of OTSI on an ongoing basis as par
t of OTSI™s 
reporting obligations to Government.
   Apart from the matters mentioned above, Transport fo
r NSW does not have any other contingent liabilitie
s or contingent 
assets that would significantly impact on the state
 of affairs of Transport for NSW or have a material
 effect on these financial 
statements.

 Restatement of infrastructure assets 
 In previous years, Transport for NSW has carried bo
red and excavated tunnels and earthworks including 
cuttings and 
embankments at nil value on the basis that the asse
ts could not be reliably measured. In 2017, Transpo
rt for NSW valued 
these assets using advances in technology, improved
 asset management systems, equipment and technical 
asset 
information. On balance, it now appears it may have
 been possible to reliably value these assets in a 
prior year. As a result, 
Transport for NSW recorded an additional $29.9 mill
ion in tunnel boring assets and $4,228.8 million in
 earthworks to correct 
the value of infrastructure assets as at 1 July 201
6 with an adjustment to equity. The nature of the i
nputs to the valuation 
made it impractical to retrospectively restate prev
iously reported balances. 
 
 
 Financial instruments 
 Transport for NSW™s principal financial instruments
 are outlined below. These financial instruments ar
e required to finance 
Transport for NSW™s operations and manage forecast 
cash flow exposures.  
 
Transport for NSW does not enter into or trade fina
ncial instruments, including derivative financial i
nstruments, for 
speculative purposes.  

 
The operational activities of Transport for NSW exp
ose it to a variety of financial risks: credit risk
, liquidity risk and market risk 
including interest rate risk. The main risks arisin
g from these financial instruments are outlined bel
ow together with Transport 
for NSW™s objectives, policies and processes for me
asuring and managing risk.  
 
Methods used to measure risk include sensitivity an
alysis in the case of interest rate, foreign exchan
ge and other commodity 
price risks, and an ageing analysis for credit risk
. Further quantitative and qualitative disclosures 
are included throughout 
these financial statements.  

 
The Secretary has overall responsibility for the est
ablishment and oversight of risk management and rev
iew, and determines 
policies for managing each of these risks. Risk man
agement policies are established to identify and an
alyse the risks faced 
by the reporting entity, to set limits and to monit
or risks. Compliance with these policies is subject
 to review by the internal 
audit.

. not within scope of AASB 7). 
2 Excludes statutory payables and unearned revenue (i
.e. not within scope of AASB 7). 
 (b) Derecognition of financial assets and financial
 liabilities  
 A financial asset is derecognised when the contractu
al rights to the cash flows from the financial asse
ts expire; or if Transport 
for NSW transfers the financial assets: 

  

 - where substantially all the risks and rewards ha
ve been transferred; or 
 - where Transport for NSW has not transferred subs
tantially all the risks and rewards, if the reporti
ng entity has not retained 
control. 

  

Where Transport for NSW has neither transferred nor
 retained substantially all the risk and rewards or
 transferred control, the 
asset is recognised to the extent of Transport for 
NSW™s continuing involvement in the asset. 
  

A financial liability is derecognised when the oblig
ation specified in the contract is discharged or ca
ncelled or expires. 
 (c) Derivatives 
Transport for NSW held $0.05 million (2017:$1 milli
on) in derivative financial assets and $1.7 million
 (2017: $1.5 million) in 
derivative financial liabilities 
 
Foreign exchange risk management 
 Transport for NSW only uses derivatives for hedging
 purposes and not as trading or speculative instrum
ents. Forward foreign 
exchange contracts are used to mitigate exchange ra
te exposure arising from firm commitments for the p
urchase of goods 
and services in foreign currency.

measuring the hedging instruments at fair value is 
recognised in other 
comprehensive income and deferred in equity in the 
hedging reserve, to the extent that the hedge is ef
fective. There was no 
hedge ineffectiveness in the current year.

Energy price risk management 

 Transport for NSW is exposed to energy price risk a
ssociated with the purchase of energy to operate tr
ansport services. 
 
It is Transport for NSW™s policy to manage the ener
gy price exposure arising from its energy load by e
ntering into fixed price 
supply arrangements with retailers or to hedge fore
cast exposures on a portion of its energy load for 
periods up to 15 years
. 
 
The exposure to fluctuations in the wholesale marke
t prices is managed through the use of a derivative
 financial instrument. 
 (d) Credit risk 
 Credit risk arises where a debtor or counterparty d
oes not complete their obligations, resulting in fi
nancial loss to Transport 
for NSW. 

 
Credit risk can arise from financial assets of the 
reporting entity, including cash and cash equivalen
ts, deposits with banks 
and TCorp, as well as credit exposure to customers,
 including outstanding receivables and committed tr
ansactions and 
derivative financial instruments. Transport for NSW
 holds bank guarantees for significant customers as
 well as property 
bonds for some leased premises. Transport for NSW h
as not granted any financial guarantees.  
 
Credit risk policy is aimed at minimising the poten
tial for counter party default.

  Financial instruments (cont™d) 
 (d)        Credit risk (cont™d) 
 
Credit risk associated with Transport for NSW™s fin
ancial assets other than receivables, is managed th
rough the sound 
selection of counterparties and establishment of mi
nimum credit rating standards. All debt management 
and investment 
activities are undertaken with TCorp, which is guar
anteed by the NSW Government.  
 
Credit risk impacts on the following financial inst
ruments which are discussed below: 
 
Cash 

Cash comprises cash on hand and bank balances withi
n the NSW Treasury Banking System. Interest is earned
 on daily bank 
balances at the current Reserve Bank of Australia of
ficial cash rate. 
 
Derivatives  

Transport for NSW limits its exposure to credit ris
k by entering into derivative financial instruments
 only with approved 
counterparties that have an acceptable credit ratin
g. Derivative counterparties are limited to high cr
editworthy organisations 
in the energy industry. Transport for NSW also util
ises International Swaps and Derivative Association (
ISDA) agreements 
with derivative counterparties in order to limit ex
posure to credit risk through the netting of amount
s receivable from and 
amounts payable to individual counterparties. 

 
Receivables - trade debtors 

All trade debtors are recognised as amounts receivab
le at balance date. Collectability of trade debtors
 is reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Procedures as established in the Trea
surer™s Directions are followed to recover outstand
ing amounts, 
including letters of demand. Debts which are known 
to be uncollectible are written off. An allowance fo
r impairment is raised 
when there is objective evidence that the reporting
 entity will not be able to collect all amounts due
. This evidence includes 
past experience, and current and expected changes i
n economic conditions and debtor credit ratings. No
 interest is earned 
on trade debtors. Sales are generally made on 30 day
 terms. 
Transport for NSW is not materially exposed to conc
entrations of credit risk to a single trade debtor 
or group of debtors. 
Debtors of $0.7 million (2017: $0.1 million) is con
sidered impaired of debtors of $9.5 million (2017: 
$19.9 million) past due as 
at 30 June 2018. 

 
The only financial assets that are past due are ''Sa
le of goods and services'' in the ''Receivables'' c
ategory of the Statement 
of financial position.

 (e)        Liquidity risk 
 Liquidity risk is the risk that Transport for NSW w
ill be unable to meet its payment obligations when 
they fall due. Transport 
for NSW continuously manages risk through monitorin
g future cash flows and maturities planning to ensu
re adequate holding 
of high quality liquid assets. The objective is to 
maintain a balance between continuity of funding an
d flexibility through the 
use of loans and other advances.  
 Transport for NSW has access to credit facilities w
ith TCorp of $467.0 million (2017: $467.0 million) 
of which $365.1 million 
(2017: $367.6 million) had been used at reporting d
ate.  
 
During the current and prior year, there were no de
faults of loans payable and no assets have been ple
dged as collateral. 
Transport for NSW™s exposure to liquidity risk is d
eemed insignificant based on prior periods™ data an
d current assessment of 
risk.  

 
The liabilities are recognised for amounts due to b
e paid in the future for goods or services received
, whether or not invoiced. 
Amounts owing to suppliers (which are unsecured) are
 settled in accordance with the policy set out in N
SW TC 11/12. For 
small business suppliers, where terms are not speci
fied, payment is made not later than 30 days from d
ate of receipt of a 
correctly rendered invoice. For other suppliers, if
 trade terms are not specified, payment is made no 
later than the end of the 
month following the month in which an invoice or a 
statement is received. For small business suppliers
, where payment is not 
made within the specified time period, simple inter
est must be paid automatically unless an existing c
ontract specifies 
otherwise.

 (f)          Market risk 
 
Market risk relates to fluctuations in the fair val
ue of future cash flows of financial instruments be
cause of changes in market 
prices. Transport for NSW™s exposure to market risk
 is primarily through interest rate risk on Transpo
rt for NSW™s borrowings, 
foreign exchange risks associated with overseas pur
chase commitments and other price risks associated 
with the movement 
in the unit price of the TCorp Hour-Glass Investmen
t Facility.  
 
The effect on net result and equity due to a reason
able possible change in risk variable is outlined i
n the information provided 
below, for interest rate risk and other price risk 
including currency movements. A reasonable possible
 change in risk variable 
has been determined after taking into account the e
conomic environment in which Transport for NSW oper
ates and the time 
frame for the assessment (i.e. until the end of the
 next annual reporting period). The sensitivity ana
lysis is based on risk 
exposures in existence at the balance date. The ana
lysis assumes that all other variables remain const
ant.  
 
Transport for NSW does not enter into commodity con
tracts. 
 Interest rate risk 

 
Exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily thr
ough Transport for NSW™s interest bearing liabiliti
es. This risk is minimised by 
undertaking mainly fixed rate borrowings, primarily
 TCorp. Transport for NSW does not account for any 
fixed rate financial 
instruments at fair value through profit or loss or
 as available-for-sale. Therefore, for these financ
ial instruments, a change in 
interest rates would not affect profit or loss or e
quity. A reasonably possible change of +/- 1% is use
d, consistent with current 
trends in interest rates (based on official RBA inter
est rate volatility over the last five years). The 
basis will be reviewed 
annually and amended where there is a structural ch
ange in the level of interest rate volatility.  
 
Transport for NSW's exposure to interest rate risk

 Foreign exchange risk 

 
Exposure to foreign exchange risk arises primarily 
through the contractual commercial transactions den
ominated in a foreign 
currency. The risk is measured using sensitivity an
alysis and cash flow forecasting.  
 
Transport for NSW manages its foreign exchange risk
 by entering into forward exchange contracts in acc
ordance with the 
Transport for NSW risk management policies.  

 
Foreign exchange risk related to the principal amou
nt of overseas purchase commitments made, that are 
primarily 
denominated in Euros and US dollars, have been fully 
hedged using forward contracts that mature on the s
ame dates as the 
forecast purchase are due for payment. These contra
cts are designated as cash flow hedges.  
 
Transport for NSW™s exposure to foreign exchange ri
sk is set out in the table below, with all other va
riables being held 
constant. All underlying exposure and related hedges
 are taken into account. The impact on other compre
hensive income is 
due to changes in the fair value of the financial i
nstruments. The impact on equity is due to changes 
in the fair value of forward 
exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedge.  

 
A sensitivity of 10% movement in the exchange rates 
has been selected for use in the sensitivity analys
is at the reporting 
date, as this is considered reasonable, based on th
e current Australian dollar level and the historical
 volatility of the Australian 
dollar against other currencies. Based on the value 
of the Australian dollar at the reporting date as co
mpared with the 
currencies below, adverse or favourable movements i
n the foreign exchange rates would result in an inc
rease or decrease in 
the Australian dollar fair value respectively.

  (g)         Fair value compared to carrying amount 

 Financial instruments are generally recognised at c
ost, with the exception of the TCorp Hour-Glass fac
ilities and derivatives, 
which are measured at fair value.  

 
The fair values of financial instrument assets and 
liabilities are determined as follow: 
· the fair value of financial instrument assets and 
liabilities with standard terms and conditions and 
traded in active 
liquid markets are determined with reference to quo
ted market prices; and  
· the fair value of other financial instrument asset
s and liabilities are determined in accordance with
 generally accepted 
pricing models based on discounted cash flow analys
is. 
 
The amortised cost of all other financial instrumen
ts recognised in the Statement of financial positio
n approximates the fair 
value, because of the short-term nature of many of 
the financial instruments, with the exception of TC
orp borrowings.  
 
The following table details the financial instrumen
ts where the fair value differs from the carrying a

Transport for NSW uses the following hierarchy for 
disclosing the fair value of financial instruments 
by valuation technique: 
 
Level 1 - Derived from quoted prices in active mark
ets for identical assets / liabilities. 
Level 2 - Derived from inputs other than quoted pri
ces that are observable directly or indirectly. 
Level 3 - Derived from valuation techniques that in
clude inputs for the asset / liability not based on
 observable market data 
(unobservable inputs) 

 
Transport for NSW has assessed the fair value of it
s foreign exchange derivatives on the basis of inpu
ts other than quoted 
prices that are observed directly or indirectly (Le
vel 2). 
 
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contract
s is determined using forward exchange rates at the
 reporting date.  
 
The fair value of the energy derivative is determin
ed as the present value of future contracted cash f
lows and credit 
adjustments. Cash flows are discounted using standa
rd valuation techniques at applicable market yield 
having regard to timing 
of cash flows. 

 
There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 dur
ing the year.  
 
There were no changes in the valuation techniques d
uring the year.

It is accountable for the 
transactions relating to those administered activit
ies but does not have discretion, for example, to d
eploy the resources for the 
achievement of Transport for NSW™s own objectives. 

  

Transactions and balances relating to the administe
red activities are not recognised as Transport for 
NSW™s income, expenses, 
assets and liabilities, but disclosed in the accomp
anying schedules as ﬁAdministered incomeﬂ, ﬁAdministe
red expensesﬂ, 
ﬁAdministered assetsﬂ and ﬁAdministered liabilitiesﬂ.
  
The accrual basis of accounting and applicable acco
unting standards has been adopted. 
 
 After balance date events 
 
On 1 July 2018, Sydney Metro was constituted as a co
rporation under the 
Transport Administration Amendment (Sydney
 Metro) 
Act 2018
. As a result of this, the Minister for Transport a
nd Infrastructure approved the transfer of certain 
assets and liabilities 
(net $6,262.4 million), including prepaid assets an
d assets under construction, from Transport for NSW
 to Sydney Metro, 
effective 1 July 2018. 

 
Metropolitan bus operations for the Southern region 
(region 6) previously carried out by State Transit A
uthority (STA) under 
contract with Transport for NSW are carried out by 
Transit System West Services Pty Limited (Transit Sys
tems West) from 1 
July 2018. The Minister for Transport and Infrastru
cture approved the transfer of bus, land, buildings
 and other assets and 
liabilities (net $725.8 million) from STA to Transpor
t for NSW relating to region 6 as well as the STA ope
rated regions 7, 8, and 
9, effective 1 July 2018. Assets related to region 
6 are then leased from Transport for NSW to Transit
 Systems West, and 
assets related to regions 7, 8, and 9 are then leas
ed from Transport for NSW to STA. 
 
On 3 July 2018 Transport for NSW entered into an ag
reement that provides a guarantee of up to $500.0 m
illion against a 
borrowing facility provided by some of the private 
sector debt providers to ALTRAC Light Rail Consortium
 (ALTRAC), which is 
currently constructing the Sydney Light Rail. ALTRAC™s
 borrowing facility has three tranches totalling $5
00.0 million.  The first 
tranche of $100.0 million was advanced by those len
ders to ALTRAC on 3 July 2018.  The second tranche of
 $100.0 million has 
been made available to be drawn down by ALTRAC from 2
0 September 2018 once certain conditions have been m
et. The 
remaining tranche cannot be advanced to ALTRAC by its
 lenders unless certain conditions are met, includi
ng the agreement of 
Transport for NSW.   As this guarantee is a conting
ent liability, there is no impact to the financial 
position of Transport for NSW 
as a result of providing this guarantee. The extent
 to which the guarantee may be called upon will dep
end on a number of 
factors, including the ultimate resolution of vario
us commercial disputes between Transport for NSW an
d ALTRAC.

 Summary of significant accounting policies 
 (a) Reporting entity 
 
The Transport Service of New South Wales (Transport 
Service) was established on 1 November 2011 as a not
-for-profit  
agency (as profit is not its principal objective) t
o employ staff to enable Transport for NSW, which c
annot directly employ 
staff, to undertake its functions. Transport Servic
e also directly employs staff for Roads and Maritim
e Services (RMS), State 
Transit Authority (STA), as well as senior executives 
of Sydney Trains and NSW Trains.  
 
The salaries and related costs are recovered from t
he relevant entities to which the employees are ass
igned except for long 
service leave and defined benefits superannuation s
cheme expenses relating to Transport for NSW, RMS an
d all senior 
executives which are assumed by the Crown. 

 
Transport Service is a NSW government entity contro
lled by the Department of Transport. The financial 
statements of 
Transport Service are consolidated in the Department
 of Transport financial statements and the NSW Tota
l State Sector, 
which is the ultimate parent. 

 
The financial statements of Transport Service for t
he year ended 30 June 2018 were authorised for issu
e by the Secretary on 
the date the accompanying statement was signed. 

 (b) Basis of preparation 
 The financial statements are general purpose financ
ial statements which have been prepared on an accru
al basis in 
compliance with: 

 · Applicable Australian Accounting Standards (which inclu
de Australian Accounting Interpretations); 
· The requirements of the 
Public Finance and Audit Act 1983
 and 
Public Finance and Audit Regulation
 2015
; and 
· Financial Reporting Directions mandated by the NSW 
Treasurer. 
 
Financial statements items are prepared in accordan
ce with the historical cost convention except for s
uperannuation. 
 
All amounts are rounded to the nearest one thousand 
dollars and are expressed in Australian currency, w
hich is the entity™s 
presentation and functional currency. 
 (c) Critical accounting estimates, judgements and a
ssumptions 
 In the application of accounting standards, managem
ent is required to make judgements, estimates and a
ssumptions about 
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that 
are not readily apparent from other sources.  
 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based 
on historical experience and various factors that a
re believed to be 
reasonable under the current set of circumstances. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
Management evaluates these judgements, estimates an
d assumptions on an ongoing basis. Revisions to est
imates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimates are
 revised if the revision affects only that period, 
or in the period of the 
revision and future periods if the revision affects
 both current and future periods. 
 
The judgements, key assumptions and estimates manag
ement has made are disclosed in the relevant notes 
to the financial 
statements. 

 (d) Statement of compliance 
 The financial statements and notes comply with the 
Australian Accounting Standards, which include Australi
an Accounting 
Interpretations.

  1.      Summary of significant accounting policies 
(cont™d) 
 (e) Comparative information 
 Except when an Australian Accounting Standard permit
s or requires otherwise, comparative information is
 presented in 
respect of the previous period for all amounts repo
rted in the financial statements. 
  
(f) Changes in accounting policy, including new or 
revised Australian Accounting Standards 
 (i) Effective for the first time in 2018 
 The accounting policies applied in 2018 are consist
ent with those of the previous financial year. The 
amendments to 
Australian Accounting Standards that are effective for
 the first time in 2018 had no significant impact o
n the financial 
statements. 
 (ii) New Australian Accounting Standards issued but 
not effective 
 Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations th
at have been issued or revised but are not yet effe
ctive have not been 
early adopted in accordance with Treasury mandated 
policy.

3, 
AASB 2016-7 and AASB 2016-8 has application from annual rep
orting periods on or after 1 January 2019. Transpor
t Service 
is yet to undertake a detailed assessment of the im
pact of AASB 15.  This standard is expected to impact 
the timing of 
recognition of certain revenue given the core princ
iple of the new standard requires revenue to be rec
ognised when the 
goods or services are transferred to the customer a
t the transaction price (as opposed to stage of com
pletion of the 
transaction). The model features a contract-based f
ive-step analysis of transactions to determine reve
nue recognition. 
 The impact of the following standards in the period
 of initial application is not expected be signific

 Revenue (cont™d) 
 Recognition and Measurement 
 Income is recognised and measured at the fair value
 of the consideration or contribution received or r
eceivable to the extent 
that it is probable that the economic benefit will 
flow to Transport Service and the income can be reli
ably measured.  
 
Revenue from the rendering of personnel services is
 recognised when the service is provided and only t
o the extent that the 
associated recoverable expenses are recognised

 Recognition and Measurement 
 Receivables are recognised when it is probable that
 the future cash inflows associated with them will 
be realised and they 
have a value that can be measured reliably. They ar
e derecognised when the contractual or other rights
 to future cash flows 
from it expire or are transferred. 

 
Receivables are recognised initially at fair value,
 usually based on the transaction cost. Subsequent m
easurement is at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method,
 less an allowance for any impairment of receivable
s. Any changes are 
recognised in the net result for the year when impa
ired, derecognised or through the amortisation proc
ess. 
 
Short-term receivables with no stated interest rate 
are measured at the original invoice amount where t
he effect of 
discounting is immaterial.

  Payables (cont™d) 
Recognition and Measurement 
 Payables include accrued salaries and wages and rela
ted on-costs (such as payroll tax, fringe benefits 
tax, workers™ 
compensation insurance) where there is certainty as
 to the amount and timing of settlement. 
 
A payable is recognised when a present obligation ar
ises under a contract or otherwise. It is derecogni
sed when the 
obligation expires or is discharged, cancelled or s
ubstituted. 
 
Payables are recognised initially at fair value, usu
ally based on the transaction cost. Subsequent measu
rement is at

original invoice amount where the effect of discoun
ting is immaterial.

It is estimated that the provision for annual leave
 includes an amount of $5.1 million that is expecte
d to be taken after 30 
June 2019 (after 30 June 2018: $3.3 million).
  2 The provision for long service leave represents co
nsequential costs not assumed by the Crown Entity fo
r Transport for 
NSW and RMS Employment Groups and the provision for l
ong service leave and associated consequential cost
s for State 
Transit Authority (STA) Employment Group of Transport 
Service as per NSW TC 15/09. It is estimated that t
he current 
provision for long service leave includes an amount
 of $106.3 million that is expected to be taken aft
er 30 June 2019 (after 30 
June 2018: $116.2 million).

 Employee benefits (cont™d) 
 Recognition and Measurement 

 (i) Salaries and wages, annual leave, sick leave and
 on-costs 
 
Salaries and wages (including non-monetary benefits)
 and paid sick leave that are expected to be settle
d wholly within 12 
months after the end of the period in which the emp
loyees render the service are recognised and measur
ed at the 
undiscounted amounts of the benefits. 

 
Annual leave is not expected to be settled wholly be
fore 12 months after the end of the annual reportin
g period in which the 
employees render the related service. As such, it is
 required to be measured at present value in accord
ance with AASB 119 
Employee Benefits (although short-cut methods are per
mitted). Actuarial advice obtained by Treasury has c
onfirmed that the 
use of a nominal approach plus the annual leave on 
annual leave liability (using 7.9% of the nominal v
alue of annual leave) 
can be used to approximate the present value of the
 annual leave liability. Transport Service has asses
sed the actuarial 
advice based on Transport Service™s circumstances an
d has determined that the effect of discounting is 
immaterial to annual 
leave.  

 
Unused non-vesting sick leave does not give rise to
 a liability as it is not considered probable that 
sick leave taken in the 
future will be greater than the benefits accrued in
 the future. 
 (ii) Long service leave and superannuation 
 
Transport Services™ liabilities for long service le
ave and defined benefit superannuation are either a
ssumed by the Crown 
Finance Entity or the entity itself.  

 
For liabilities that are assumed by the Crown Finan
ce Entity, Transport Service accounts for the liabil
ity as having been 
extinguished, resulting in the amount assumed being
 shown as part of the non-monetary revenue item des
cribed as 
'Acceptance by the Crown Finance Entity of employee b
enefits and other liabilities'. 
 
Long service leave is measured at present value in 
accordance with AASB 119 
Employee Benefits
. This is based on the 
application of certain factors (specified in NSW TC
 15/09) to employees with five or more years of ser
vice, using current rates 
of pay. These factors were determined based on an a
ctuarial review to approximate present value.  
 
The superannuation expense recognised in the Stateme
nt of comprehensive income comprises: 
· defined contribution plans, the expense is calculat
ed as a percentage of  the employees™ salary;  
· defined benefit plans, the expense is a multiple of
 the employees™ superannuation contributions as spe
cified in the 
Treasury Circular 
ﬁAccounting for Superannuationﬂ
 (NSW TC 17/07). 
 When liabilities are assumed by Transport Service, t
hey are recognised in the Statement of financial pos
ition and measured 
as follows: 
· Long service leave is measured as the present value
 of expected future payments to be made in respect 
of employee™s 
service up to the reporting date, in accordance wit
h AASB 119 
Employee Benefits
. This is based on an actuarial 
assessment. Consideration is given to the expected 
future wage and salary levels, experience of employ
ee departures 
and period of service.  
· Contributions to defined contribution plans are exp
ensed when incurred. The superannuation expense is 
calculated as a 
percentage of the employee™s salary. A liability is 
recognised only to the extent of unpaid employer co
ntributions at 
reporting date.

 Employee benefits (cont™d) 
 Recognition and Measurement (cont™d) 
 (ii) Long service leave and superannuation (cont™d)
  · For defined benefit plans, actuarial valuations are
 carried out at each reporting date by Mercer and t
he actuarial gains 
and losses are recognised outside of the net result
 in other comprehensive income in the year in which
 they occur. 
Expenses are recognised based on service costs plus
 net interest on the net liability or asset for the
 reporting period as 
calculated and advised by Mercer. A net liability o
r asset is recognised based on the difference betwe
en the present 
value of Transport Services™ defined benefit obligat
ions and the fair value of fund assets as at the re
porting date, as 
adjusted for any asset ceiling. The net liability o
r asset is actuarially determined.
(iii) Consequential on-costs 
 
Consequential costs to employment are recognised as
 liabilities and expenses where the employee benefi
ts to which they 
relate have been recognised.  This includes outstan
ding amounts of payroll tax, workers™ compensation 
insurance premiums 
and fringe benefits tax. 

 
Defined benefit superannuation overview  

 
This overview only relates to the STA Employment Group
 whose defined benefit superannuation schemes are n
ot assumed 
by the Crown Entity.   

 
Employer contributions are made to three defined ben
efit superannuation schemes administered by the SAS Tr
ustee 
Corporation (STC): The State Authorities Superannuation
 Scheme (SASS), the State Authorities Non-contributory 
Superannuation Scheme (SANCS) and the State Superannuatio
n Scheme (SSS), which are part of the Pooled Fund.  Each
 
scheme is closed to new members and its investments
 are held in trust by the Pooled Fund.  At least a co
mponent of the final 
benefit is derived from a multiple of members' sala
ry and years of membership.  All fund assets are inv
ested by SAS Trustee 
Corporation at arm™s length through independent fun
d managers. 
 
An underfunded scheme is recognised as a provision a
nd an overfunded scheme is recognised as an asset. 
 Details of both 
provisions and assets are given below.

The accrued liability includes a contribution tax p

he deficit/(surplus) less 
the allowance for past service expenses and insurab
le death and disability liabilities at a contributi
on tax rate of 15%. 
    

Note 2 

The Future Service Liability (FSL) does not have to 
be recognised by an employer.  It is only used to d
etermine if an asset 
ceiling limit should be imposed (AASB 119 para 64).  Un
der AASB 119, any prepaid superannuation asset recogni
sed cannot 
exceed the present value of any economic benefits t
hat may be available in the form of refunds from th
e plan or reductions in 
future contributions to the plan.  Where the ﬁsurpl
us in excess of recoveryﬂ is zero, no asset ceiling
 limit is imposed. 
 (Note: this also includes a contribution tax provi
sion).

State Authorities Superannuation Act 1987, Police Regul
ation (Superannuation) Act 1906, State Authorities Non-
Contributory 
Superannuation Act 1987, and their associated regulat

The schemes in the Pooled Fund are exempt public sec
tor superannuation schemes under the Commonwealth 
Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (SIS). Th
e SIS Legislation treats exempt public sector superan
nuation funds 
as complying funds for concessional taxation and su
perannuation guarantee purposes.  
 
Under a Heads of Government agreement, the New South
 Wales Government undertakes to ensure that the Pool
ed Fund  
will conform with the principles of the Commonwealt
h™s retirement incomes policy relating to preservat
ion, vesting and 
reporting to members and that members™ benefits are
 adequately protected.  
 
The New South Wales Government prudentially monitors
 and audits the Pooled Fund and the Trustee Board ac
tivities in a 
manner consistent with the prudential controls of t
he SIS legislation. These provisions are in addition 
to other legislative 
obligations on the Trustee Board and internal proces
ses that monitor the Trustee Board™s adherence to th
e principles of the 
Commonwealth™s retirement incomes policy.  

 
An actuarial investigation of the Pooled Fund is perf
ormed every three years. The last actuarial investi
gation was performed 
as at 30 June 2018. 

  · Description of other entities' responsibilities for
 the governance of the fund - Para 139(a)(iii)

e of the Fund. The Trustee has a legal obligation t
o act solely in the best

 · Description of risks - Para 139(b) 
 
There are a number of risks to which the Fund expos
es the Employer. The more significant risks relating
 to the defined 
benefits are: 

 
* Investment risk - The risk that investment return
s will be lower than assumed and the Employer will 
need to increase 
contributions to offset this shortfall. 

* Longevity risk Œ The risk that pensioners live lo
nger than assumed, increasing future pensions. 
* Pension indexation risk Œ The risk that pensions w
ill increase at a rate greater than assumed, increa
sing future pensions. 
* Salary growth risk - The risk that wages or salari
es (on which future benefit amounts for active memb
ers will be based) will      
rise more rapidly than assumed, increasing defined 
benefit amounts and thereby requiring additional em
ployer contributions. 
* Legislative risk - The risk is that legislative c
hanges could be made which increase the cost of pro
viding the defined 
benefits. 

 
The defined benefit fund assets are invested with i
ndependent fund managers and have a diversified ass
et mix. The Fund 
has no significant concentration of investment risk
 or liquidity risk.    
 · Description of significant events - Para 139(c)

lements during the year.

Transport Service of New South Wales
 
 
To Members of the New
 
South
 
Wales Parliament
 
Opinion
 
I have audited the accompanying financial statements of 
Transport Service of New South Wales (the 
Service), which comprise the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year ended 30
 
June
 
2018, 
the Statement of Financial Position as at 30
 
June
 
2018, the Statement of Changes in Equity and the 
Statement of Cash F
lows for the year then ended, notes comprising a Statement of Significant 
Accounting Policies and other explanatory information.
 
In my opinion, the financial statements:
 

 
give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Service as at 30
 
June
 
2018,
 
and of its 
financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Australian 
Accounting Standards 
 

 
are in accordance with section 41B of the 
Public Finance and Audit Act 1983
 
(PF&A Act) and 
the Public Finance and Audit Regulat
ion 2015
 
 
 
 
My opinion should be read in conjunction with the rest of this report.
 
 
Basis for Opinion
 
I conducted my audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. My responsibilities under the 

section of my report. 
 
I am independent of the Servic
e in accordance with the requirements of the:
 

 
Australian Auditing Standards 
 

 


 
 
I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in acc
ordance with APES 110.
 
Parliament promotes independence by ensuring the Auditor
-
General and the Audit Office of 
New
 
South
 
Wales are not compromised in their roles by:
 

 
providing that only Parliament, and not the executive government, can remove an 
 
Auditor
-
G
eneral
 

 
mandating the Auditor
-
General as auditor of public sector agencies
 

 
precluding the Auditor
-
General from providing non
-
audit services.
 
 
I believe the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my 
audit opinion.
 
 
 
 
Other Information
 

30
 
June
 

Secretary
 
of the 
Service is
 
respon
sible for the other information. At the date of this Independent 

Statement by 
Secretary
.
 
My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information. Accordingly, I do not
 
express any form of assurance conclusion on the other information.
 
In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsist
ent with the 
financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated.
 
If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude there is a material misstatement of the other 
information, I must report that fact.
 
I have nothing to report in this regard.
 

 
The Secretary is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in 
accordance with Australian Accounting Standards a
nd the PF&A Act, and for such internal control as 
the Secretary determines is necessary to enable the preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
In preparing the f

going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting except where the Service will be dissolved by an
 
Act of Parliament or otherwise 
cease operations. 
 

 
My objectives are to:
 

 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement,
 
whether due to fraud or error
 

 

 
 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee an audit conducted in 
accordance with Australian Auditing Standards will always detect ma
terial misstatements. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error. Misstatements are considered material if, individually or 
in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions users take 
based on the financial statements.
 
A
 
description of my responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located at the Auditing 
and Assurance Standards Board website at: 
www.auasb.gov.au/auditors_responsib
ilities/ar4.pdf
.
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
My opinion does 
not
 
provide assurance:
 

 
that the Service carried out its activities effectively, efficiently and economically 
 

 
about the security and controls over the electronic publicatio
n of the audited financial 
statements on any website where they may be presented
 

 
about any other information which may have been hyperlinked to/from the financial statements.

Summary of 
significant accounting policies
 
 
(a)
 
Reporting entity
 
 
Sydney Ferries
 
is a statutory corporation established by the 
Transport Administration Act 1988
. 
Sydney Ferries 


Public Finance and Audit Act 1983
 
and is a controlled entity of Transport for NSW
. 
T
ransport for 
NSW is a controlled entity of 
the Department of Transport 
which
 
is consolidated as part of the NSW Total State 
Sector
 
(
ultimate parent
).
 
 
Sydney Ferries 
was initially established to deliver 
public ferry services in Sydney. On 3 May 2012 the Minister for Transport
 
announced that Harbour City Ferries (HCF) was awarded a contract to operate ferry services on Port Jackson and the 
Parramatta River for seven years under a new Ferry System Contract
 
between HCF and Transport for NSW
. The contract 
commenced on 28 July 2012. 
Since 28 July 2012, HCF leases the vessels, land and buildings from Sydney Ferries. 
 
 
RailCorp will progressively transition to the Transport Asset Holding Entity (TAHE). TAHE may e
ventually hold additional 
public transport assets for the State, including ferry vessel assets currently held by Sydney Ferries. The transfer of assets
 
is 
intended to occur progressively over the next few years.
 
 
The financial statements were 
authorised fo
r issue by the Acting Chief Executive on the date on which the accompanying 
Statement by the Chief Executive
 
was signed.
 
 
(b)
 
Basis of preparation
 
 
The financial statements of Sydney Ferries have been prepared as general purpose financial statements on an accr
ual basis 
in accordance with: 
 

 
applicable Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations;
 

 
the requirements of the 
Public Finance and Audit Act 1983 
and 
the 
Public Finance and Audit Regulation 2015
; and
 

 
Financial Reporting Directions 
mandated
 
by the 
NS
W 
Treasurer. 
 
 
 
All amounts are rounded to the nearest one thousand dollars unless otherwise stated and are expressed in Australian 
currency.
 
 
(c)
 
Statement of c
ompliance
 
 
The financial statements and notes comply with Australian Accounting Standards, which 
include Australian Accounting 
Interpretations.
 
(d)
 
Basis of measurement
 
 
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain classes of property, 
plant and equipment and intangible assets, which are measured at fair value. 
 
 
 
(e)
 
Use of estimates and judg
e
ments
 
 
The preparation of f
inancial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates. E
stimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimate are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. 
 
 
The judgements, key assumptions and estimates managem
ent has made are disclosed in the relevant notes to the financial 
statements.

(e)
       

 
 
(i)
 
Critical judgements in applying the accounting policies:
 
 
Determination of for
-
profit or not
-
fo
r
-
profit
 
Sydney Ferries is a not
-
for
-
profit entity as profit is not its principal objective.
 
 
Going concern
 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that payment of liabilities will be met, 
as and when they fall du
e, without any intention or necessity to liquidate assets or otherwise wind up operations.
 
 
 
(f)
 
Taxes
 
 
(i)
 
Accounting for Goods and Services Tax (GST)
 
 
In relation to GST,
 
revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where 
the amount of 
GST incurred by Sydney Ferries as a purchaser is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office
. In such cases, the 
GST incurred is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of an asset or as part of an item of expense.
 
 
Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. 
Cash flows are included in the statement of cash 
flows on a gross basis.  
However, the GST components of cash flows arising from investing activities which is recoverable or 
payable to th
e Australian Taxation Office are classified as operating cash flows.
 
 
(ii)
 
Income Tax
 
 
NSW Treasury has advised that Sydney Ferries is exempt from the Tax Equivalent Regime for Government Businesses 
(Treasury Policy Paper 03
-
4). Accordingly, tax effect accounti
ng is not prepared.
 
 
(iii)
 
State t
axes
 
 
Sydney Ferries is exempt from land tax. 
 
 
(g)
 
Comparatives
 
 
Except when an Australian Accounting Standard permits or requires otherwise, comparative information is disclosed in 
respect of the previous period for all amounts re
ported in the financial statements.
 
 
(h)
 
Allocation between current and non
-
current assets and liabilities
 
 
In the determination of whether an asset or liability is current or non
-
current, consideration is given to the time when each 
asset or liability is expe
cted to be settled. The asset or liability is classified as current if it is expected to be settled within the 

 
unconditional right
 
to defer settlement beyond 12 months, such as vested long service leave, the liability is classified as 
current even if not expected to be se
ttled within the next 12 months
.

(i)
 
Changes in accounting policy, including new or revised Australian Accounting Standards
 
 
(i)
 
Effe
c
tive for the first time in 20
18
 
 
The accounting policies applied in 
20
1
8
 
are consistent with those of the previous financial year
.
 
The 
amendments to
 
Australian Accounting Standards 
that are effective for the first time 
in 20
18 had no significant impact on the financial 
statements
.
 
 
(ii)
 
New 
Au
stralian Accounting Standards i
ssued but not yet effective
 
 
Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have been issued or revised but are not yet effective have not been 
early adopted in accordance with Treasury mandated policy. 
 
 
Sydney 
Ferries is currently undertaking a detailed assessment of the impact of the following standards:
 
 

 
AASB 16 
Leases
 
will apply to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The standard 
introduces a new approach to lease accounting that re
quires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for the 
rights and obligations created by leases
. 
The application of this standard is expected to
 
have a significant 
transitional impact as a result of all leases
, except 
those that are 
short term and low
 
value,
 
brought on
 
balance 
sheet
.
 
 

 
AASB 1058 
Income of Not
-
for
-
profit Entities
 
will apply to 
annual reporting periods
 
beginning
 
on or after 1 January 
2019. 
AASB 1004 
Contributions
 
has been amended with many of its requirements being revised and relocated t
o 
the new AASB 1058. The initial application of this standard may defer the recognition of 
income in some 
circumstances. 
 
 

 
AASB 15 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, including the amendments AASB 2014
-
5, AASB 2015
-
8, AASB 
2016
-
3, AASB 2016
-
7 and AASB 
2016
-
8 will apply to
 
annual reporting periods 
beginning 
on or after 1 January 201
9
. 
T
his standard 
is expected to
 
impact the timing 
of 
recognition of certain revenue given the new standard requires 
revenue to be recognised when the goods or services are tra
nsferred to the customer at the transaction price (as 
opposed to stage of completion of the transaction
 
at fair value
). The model features a contract
-
based five
-
step 
analysis of transactions to determine whether, how much and when revenue is recognised.
 
 

 
A
ASB 1059
 
Service Concession Arrangements: Grantors
 
will apply to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2019.
 
The standard requires the grantor to recognise a service concession asset, at current replacement 
cost, in a service concession arrangement where it controls the asset. A corresponding liability is also recognised 
depending on the nature of the considerat
ion exchanged. This standard may have a 
significant trans
itional impact 

 
arrangement with the private sector operator
.
 
 

 
AASB 9 
Financial Instruments
 
will apply to annual reporting periods beginning
 
on or after 1 January 2018. The 
impact of the standard in the period of initial application is not expected to be significant.

Leases
 
 
A distinction is made between finance leases 
(
which effectively transfer
s
 
from the lessor to the lessee substantially all the 
risks and 
rewards
 
incidental to ownership of the leased assets
)
, and operating leases 
(
under which the lessor 
does not 
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards
)
. 
Where a non
-
current asset is acqu
ired by means of a finance lease, at the 
commencement of the lease term, the asset is recognised at its fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum 
lease payments, at the inception of the lease.  The corresponding liability is established at 
the same amount.  Lease 
payments are allocated between the principal component and the interest expense. 
 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an operating expense in
 
the Statement of comprehensive income in the 
periods in which they are incurred.

Recognition and m
easurement
 
 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration or contributions received or receivable. In most cases this is the
 
value of the cash exchanged or exchangeable. Revenue is not recognised unless receipt is probable and
 
the amount is 
reliably measureable. Revenue is recognised on maj
or income categories as follows:
 
 
(i)
 
Grants
 
 
Income from grants is recognised when all of the following conditions are satisfied: 
 

 
Sydney Ferries
 
obtains control of the grant or the right to rec
eive the grant; 
 

 
it is probable that the economic benefits comprising the grant will flow to 
Sydney Ferries
, and 
 

 
the amount of the grant can be measured reliably. Income from grants is measured at the fair value of the grant 
received or receivable.
 
Sydney
 
Ferries
 
is deemed to have assumed cont
rol when the grant is received or receivable. 
Unspent grants are accounted 
for as liabilities if there is a contractual obligation to refund the unspent amounts.
 
 
(ii)
 
Investment revenue
 
 
Interest revenue is recognised in 
the Statement of comprehensive income as it accrues, using
 
the effective interest method.
 
 
(iii)
 
Rental revenue
 
 
Rental revenue 
arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight
-
line basis over the lease term
.

(i)
 
Trade and other 
receivables
 
 
Trade and other receivables are non
-
derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. These financial assets are recognised initially at fair value, usually based on the transaction cost. 
Subsequent 
measurement is at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less an allowance for any impairment of receivables. 
 
 
Any changes are accounted for in the Statement of comprehensive income when impaired, derecognised or through the 
amorti
sation process. Short
-
term receivables with no stated interest rate are measured at the original invoice amount where 
the effect of discounting is immaterial.
 
 
(ii)
 
Impairment of financial assets
 
 
All financial assets, except those measured at fair value throug
h profit or loss, are subject to an annual review for impairment. 
An allowance for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that 
Sydney Ferries
 
will not be able to collect all 
amounts due.
 
 
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, 

amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The amount of the 
impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of comprehen
sive income.
 
 
Any reversals of impairment losses are reversed through the Statement of comprehensive income, where there is objective 


must be made through the reserve. Reversals of impairment losses of financial assets carried at amortised cost cannot result 
in a carrying amount that exceeds what the carrying amount would have been had there not been an impairment loss.

Recognition and measurement
 
 
(i)
 
Acquisition of assets and capitalisation threshold
 
 
The cost method of accounting is used for the initial recording of all acquisitions of assets controlled by Sydney Ferries. C
ost 
is the amount of cash or cash equivalents paid or the fair value of the other consideration given to acquire the asset when 
ini
tially recognised in accordance with the specific requirements of other Australian Accounting Standards. Assets acquired at 
no cost, or for nominal consideration, are initially recognised at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Fair value is
 
the 
am

payment for an item is deferred beyond normal credit terms, its cost is the cash equivalent. The deferred payment amount is 
effectively 
discounted at an asset
-
specific rate. 
 
 
Property, plant and equipment costing $5,000 or more individually and having a minimum expected useful life of one year or 
more is capitalised. 
 
 
Major spares purchased specifically for particular assets or class of 
assets are, at the time of acquisition, included in the cost 
of the assets and depreciated accordingly.
 
 
(ii)
 
Revaluation of property, plant and e
quipment
 
 
Physical non
-
current assets are valued in accordance with the 
'Valuation of Physical Non
-
Current Assets 
at Fair Value' Policy 
and Guidelines Paper
 
(TPP 14
-
0
1).  This policy adopts fair value in accordance with AASB 13 
Fair Value Measurement, 
AASB 116
 
Property, Plant and Equipment
 
and 
AASB 140
 
Investment Property
.
 
 
Property, plant and equipment is measured at
 
the highest and best use by market participants that is physically possible, 
legally permissible and financially feasible. The highest and best use must be available at a period that is not remote and 
take into account the characteristics of the asset bei
ng measured, including any socio
-
political restrictions imposed by 
government.  In most cases, after taking into account these considerations, the highest and best use is the existing use. In 
limited circumstances, the highest and best use may be a feasibl
e alternative use, where there are no restrictions on use or 
where there is a feasible higher restricted alternative use.
 
 

(market approa
ch, cost approach, income approach) that maximise relevant observable inputs and minimise unobservable 
inputs.  Refer to 
Note

(ii)
 
Revaluation of property, plant and e
quipment
 

 
 
Sydney Ferries revalue land and buildings at least once every three years and each othe
r class of property, plant and 
equipment at least 
every 
five years or with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount of each asset in the class 
does not differ materially from its fair value at reporting date. The last comprehensive revaluation of ferries was completed
 
on 
30 June
 
2018
; comprehens
ive revaluations of freehold land, buildings and improvements were undertaken on 
30 June
 
2017. 
 
 
 
Interim revaluations are performed between comprehensive revaluations where cumulative changes to indicators/indices 
suggest fair value may differ materially 
from carrying value. Generally, an interim revaluation is performed by management if 
the cumulative changes in indicators/indices are less than 20%.
 
An interim formal revaluation is performed by external 
professionally qualified valuers when the cumulative
 
changes in indicators/in
dices exceed 20%. Management will assess 
whether comprehensive revaluations are required more frequently if the interim revaluations indicate movements are 
generally more than 20%.
 
 
For other assets valued using other valuation tec
hniques, any balances of accumulated depreciation at the revaluation date 
in respect of those assets are credited to the asset accounts to which they relate. The net asset accounts are then increased
 
or decreased by the revaluation increments or decrements
.
 
 
Revaluation increments are credited directly to the asset revaluation surplus, except that, to the extent that an increment 
reverses a revaluation decrement in respect of that class of asset previously recognised as an expense in the net result, the
 
inc
rement is recognised immediately as a gain in the net result.
 
 
Revaluation decrements are recognised immediately as a loss in the net result, except that, to the extent that a credit balan
ce 
exists in the asset revaluation surplus in respect of the same 
class of assets, they are debited directly to the asset revaluation 
surplus.
 
 
As a not
-
for
-
profit reporting entity, revaluation increments and decrements are offset against one another within a class of 
non
-
current assets, but not otherwise.
 
 
When revaluin
g non
-
current assets using the cost approach, the gross amount and the related accumulated depreciation are 
separately restated.
 
 
Where an asset that has previously been revalued is disposed of, any balance remaining in the asset revaluation surplus in 
res
pect of that asset is transferred to accumulated funds.
 
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial
 
year end.
 
 
The 
current
 
replacement cost is used to revalue specialised bui
ldings (designed for specific limited purposes), infrastructure 
systems an
d certain plant and equipment. Current
 


, in the normal course of business, to replace 
the existing asset with a technologically modern equivalent asset with the same economic benefits, adjusting for any 
overdesign, overcapacity and redundant components.
 
 
For vessels which are specialised assets
, 
current
 
replacement cost is determined by reference to the most appropriate 
modern, depreciated equivalent replacement asset that provided similar economic benefits.

(ii)
 
Revaluation of property, plant and e
quipment
 

 
 
Non
-
specialised assets with short useful lives are 
measured at depreciated historical cost, as a surrogate for fair value.
 
When revaluing non
-
current assets by reference to current prices for assets newer than those being revalued (adjusted to 
reflect the present condition of the assets), the gross amount 
and the related accumulated depreciation are separately 
restated. The accumulated depreciation is restated proportionately with the change in the gross carrying amount so that the 
carrying amount of the asset after revaluation equals its revalued amount. I
n all other cases the accumulated depreciation is 
 
eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net carrying amount is restated to the revalued amount of 
the asset.
 
 
(iii)
 
Work in progress
 
 
Costs relating to property, plant and equipment 
that are under construction, or are otherwise incomplete, are shown in the 
statement of financial position as work in progress and are not depreciated until the assets are brought into service.
 
 
   
(iv)      Impairment of property, plant and e
quipment
 
 
In 
respect of a not
-
for
-
profit entity, value in use is the 
current
 
replacement cost. Hence an impairment loss is unlikely to arise 
on any of Sydney Ferries' assets because the carrying amount (usually optimised replacement cost) is unlikely to exceed the 
reco
verable amount. For vessels (which are specialised assets) held for sale, an impairment loss would arise when they are 
valued at market value and not disposed of in the same financial year.
 
 
Notwithstanding this, Sydney Ferries generally reviews the carryi
ng values of major assets for objective evidence of 
impairment. Where such an indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made. An impairment loss is 
recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income when the carrying amount of an asset e
xceeds its recoverable 
amount unless the asset has been revalued in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease. When 
the impairment subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its
 

have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

d

Dry d
ocking
 
 
As part of the long
-
term maintenance program for the fleet, all vessels undergo a major refit (dry docking) on a regular basis 
(every 5 years for the Freshwater class of ferries and every 2 years for the remainder o
f the fleet). The cost of these dockings 
are capitalised and depreciated over the p
eriod to the subsequent docking or until the next revaluation date (whichever 
comes sooner).
 
HCF performs major periodic maintenance for all vessels dry dockings on behalf o
f Sydney Ferries. Costs 
incurred by HCF are capitalised and depreciated accordingly.

Right to receive
 
 
Sydney Ferries recognises the right to receive ferry spare parts
,
 
inventory and fuel stocks which Harbour City Ferries (HCF) 
under its contract
,
 
must return at the end of that contract. HCF advises Sydney Ferries 
of 
the value
 
of the right to receive 
assets as at 30 June each year based on the amount
 
and relevant values
 
of fuel and of each inventory item at the reporting 
date. The advice from HCF is used for the purpose of assessing impairment to the right to receive assets as 
at 30 June each 
year
.

Recognition and measurement
 
Fair value is the price that would be received to 
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction 
to sell the asset or transfer th
e liability takes place
 
either i
n the principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of a 
principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
 
 
A number of 

 
accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair
 
values, for both financial 
and non
-
financial assets and liabilities.  When measuring fair value, the valuation technique used maximises the use of 
relevant observable inputs and minimises the use of unobservable inputs.  Under AASB 13, 
Sydney Ferries
 
cate
gorises, for 
disclosure purposes, the valuation techniques based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:
 
 

 
Level 1 

 
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets / liabilities that 
Sydney Ferries
 
can access at the 
measurement date
.
 

 
Level 2 

 
inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly.
 

 
Level 3 

 
inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The main level 2 and level 3 inputs used by the valuers for 
p
roperty, plant and 
equipment are as follows:
 

 
Land 

 
rate per square metre of land area is determined by the external valuer based on the most comparable land 
sales evidence applicable for each property, adjusted for the specific attributes of the subject land. The external 
v


 

surrounding properties when making comparison to the sales evidence 
less
 
a
n appropriate adjustment
 
factor
 
in the 
range of 80% 
-
 
90% 
to account for 
the unique and restrictive planning provisions associated with the subject site.
 

 
Building 

 
r
eplacement cost of buildings and site improvements have been determined with reference to Rawlinsons 
Australian Construction Handbook and other industry cost publi
cations. Depreciation rates adopted take into account 
both property specific (e.g. age, condition of improvements) and market specific (e.g. depth of buyer demand) factors 
based on 
an
 
analysis of available sales evidence.
 

 
Vessels 

 
optimised replacement co
st, including delivery and professional fees were estimated by RHAS valuers 
based on the advice of a locally
-
based, reputable and long
-
standing boat
-
builder, assuming the lowest cost of 
replacing the vessel with a vessel based on the above criteria. Costs 
incurred on major periodic maintenance are 
determined by management based on the applicable Australian Accounting Standards.

These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to Sydney Ferries and other amounts. Trade and other 
payables are recognised initially at fair value, usually based on the transaction cost. Subsequent 
measurement is at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. Short
-
term payables with no stated interest rate are measured at the 
original invoice amount where the effect of discounting is immaterial.

measured at undiscounted amounts based on the amounts expected to be 
paid when the liabilities are settled.

The asset revaluation reserve is used to record increments and decrements on the revaluation of noncurrent assets. This 
accords with Sydney Ferries policy on the reval
uation of property, plant and equipment as discussed in note
 
7
. Separate 
reserve accounts are recognised in the financial statements only if such accounts are requi
red by specific legislation or 
Australian Accounting Standards (e.g. asset revaluation reserve).

Contingent liabilities
 
and contingent assets
 
 
Contingent liabilities represent matters that are unconfirmed (pending the occurrence or non
-
occurrence of an uncertain 
future event), or not reliably measurable or unlikely to be settled. However, their probab
ility of settlement is not remote. 
 
 
Contractual and other claims against 
Sydney Ferries
 
arise in the ordinary course of operations. The existence or quantum of 
each claim is usually in dispute and the outcome cannot be measured reliably. Sydney Ferries ha
d no contingent liabilities as 
at 30 June 201

-
recognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or if the 
agency
 
transfers the financial asset:
 

 
where substantially all the risks and rewards have been transferred; or
 

 
where 
the agency
 
has not transferred substantially all the risks and rewards, if the entity has not retained control. 
 
Where Sydney Ferries has neither transferred nor retained substan
tially all the risks and rewards or transferred control, the 
asset is recognised to the extent of Sydney Ferries continuing involvement in the asset. 
 
 
A financial liability is de
-
recognised when the obligation specified in the contract is disc
harged or ca
ncelled or expires.

(b)
 
Credit r
isk
 
 
Credit risk arises when there is the possibility of Sydney Ferries' debtors defaulting on their contractual obligations, resu
lting 
in a financial loss to Sydney Ferries. The maximum exposu
re to credit risk is generally represented by the carrying amount of 
the financial assets (net of any allowance for impairment). 
 
 
Credit risk arises from the financial assets of Sydney Ferries, including cash and cash equivalents and receivables and 
autho
rity deposits. No collateral is held by Sydney Ferries. Sydney Ferries has not granted any financial guarantees. 
 
 
Credit risk associated with Sydney Ferries financial assets, other than receivables, is managed through the selection of 
counterparties and e
stablishment of minimum credit rating standards.
 
 
(i)
 
Cash
 
 
Cash comprises cash on hand and bank balances 
within the NSW Treasury banking systems
. Interest is earned on daily 
bank balances at 
the current Reserve Bank of Australia official cash rate
.
 
 
(ii)
 
Receivables
 
 
At the end of the reporting period there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. Credit risk is the risk of financ
ial loss 
arising from another party to a contract or financial position failing to discharge a financial obligation th
ere under. Sydney 
Ferries' maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amounts of the financial assets included in the 
statement of financial position
.

Liqui
dity r

Liquidity risk is the risk that Sydney Ferries will be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due. Sydney Ferr
ies 
continuously manages risk through monitoring cash flows and debt maturities and planning to ensure adequate holding of 
high qua
lity liquid assets. The objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use 
of overdrafts, loans and other advances. 
 
 
No assets have been pledged as collateral. Sydney Ferries' exposure to liquidity risk is dee
med insignificant based on prior 

 
 
The liabilities are recognised for amounts due to be paid in the future for goods or services received, whether or not invoic
ed.

Fair v
alue
 
 
The amortised cost of financial instruments recognised in the statement of financial 
position
 
approximates the fair value, because of 
the short
-
term nature of many of th
e financial instruments.
 
 
(e)
 
Market r
isk
 
 
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market 
prices. Sydney Ferries has no exposure to foreign currency risk and does not enter
 
into commodity contracts. 
 
 
The effect on profit and equity due to a reasonably possible change in 
the interest rate
 
is outlined in the information below. A 
reasonably possible change in 
the interest rate
 
has been determined after taking into account the economic environment in which 
Sydney Ferries operates and the time frame for the assessment (that is, until the end of the next annual reporting period). T
he 
sensitivity analysis is based on risk exposures
 
in existence at the end of the reporting period. The analysis is performed on the 
same basis as for 
2017
. The analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
 
 
Interest rate risk
 
 
Interest rate risk is the
 
risk that the value of the financial statements will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. Sydney

In my opinion, the financial statements:
 

 
give a true and fair view of the financial position of 
Sydney Ferries
 
as at 
30
 
June
 
2018
, and of 
its financial performance and its cash flows for the 
year then ended in accordance with 
Australian Accounting Standards
 

 
are in accordance with section 41B of the 
Public Finance and Audit Act 1983
 
(PF&A Act) and 
the Public Finance and Audit Regulation 2015.
 
 
My opinion should be read in conjunction with the r
est of this report.
 
Basis for Opinion
 
I conducted my audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. My responsibilities under the 
standards are described in the 



 
section of my r
eport.
 
I am independent of 
Sydney Ferries
 
in accordance with the requirements of the:
 

 
Australian Auditing Standards
 

 


APES 110).
 
 
I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
APES 110
.
 
Parliament 
promotes independence by ensuring the 
Auditor
-
General
 
and the Audit Office of 
New
 
South
 
Wales are not compromised in their roles by:
 

 
providing that only Parliament, 
and not the executive government, can remove an 
 
Auditor

General
 

 
mandating the 
Auditor
-
General as auditor of public sector agencies
 

 
precluding the 
Auditor
-
General from providing non

I believe the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient
 
and appropriate to provide a basis for my 
audit opinion.

In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read t

consider whether 
the other information 
is materially inconsistent with the

statements or my knowledge 
obtained 
in

otherwise 
appears to be materially 
misstated.
 
If, based on the work 
I have performed, I conclude there is a material misstatement of the

if, individually or 
in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions users take 
based on the financial statements.

Cycling in Sydney









Get your bike into gear. From dedicated bike paths to mountain bike trails, cycling is great way to see Sydney. There is a cycleway across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and paths along the coast and in parklands, including Centennial Parklands, Sydney Olympic Park and Western Sydney Parklands.
A network of integrated cycle paths connects parts of Sydney City. There are also guided cycling tours, such as BlueBananas electric bikes and Bonza Bike Tours, to some of Sydney’s top sights, including historic area of The Rocks, the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
 

In the eastern suburbs is Centennial Parklands, an idyllic location for cycling. Locals and visitors alike enjoy the green oasis spread over three adjoining parks. Hire a bike from Centennial Park Cycles or bring your own and ride around these tranquil, beautiful grounds. There are lovely picnic spots, too.
You can travel with your bike on most public transport. Take a ferry to Manly and pedal to secluded coves, beaches and North Head for great harbour views. Bike hire is available from Manly Bike Tours, and there are more than 20km of bike paths and off-road trails in Manly and the Northern Beaches.
Around tranquil Narrabeen Lagoon is an 8.4km off-road nature trail. More than 190 bird species call the large coastal lagoon and surrounding parkland and bushland home. Pockets of Cabbage Tree palms tower over the trail. There are four picnic areas, all with electric barbecues, tables and toilets.
 

Over 35km of bike paths weave through Sydney Olympic Park, in Sydney’s west. Download a Bike Safari Map and choose from the 5.5km Parklands Circuit, 7.6km Olympic Circuit, or the 11km River Heritage Circuit. Young kids can ride the Children's Loop in Bicentennial Park. Bike hire is available.
Western Sydney Parklands is vast – more than 5,000 hectares. Cycling tracks snake through the green corridor, including the Wylde Mountain Bike Trail. Another mountain bike trail is in Hornsby, in Sydney’s north. The Hornsby Mountain Bike Trail is a 6km adventure in picturesque bushland.
In national parks, mountain bike trails and on-road routes meander past sandstone rock faces and in emerald forests. Devines Hill loop is part of the UNESCO World Heritage convict trail in Dharug National Park, in the Hawkesbury. For more cycling experiences, check out the Cycleway Finder.

Sydney rides
Riding a bike is a fun, healthy and sustainable way of getting around the city. Using 2 wheels can also save you time and money. 
More and more Sydneysiders are riding bikes for transport, with a 100% increase over the past 3 years. Twice as many are riding bikes for transport than the national average, and some 31,600 City of Sydney residents get on a bike in a typical week (2013 Australian Bicycle Council survey).
The City is supporting this growth in cycling by building a 200km bike network which includes dedicated bike paths separating riders from traffic and pedestrians.
City staff are out and about each week at key locations with information and advice on bike riding in Sydney and our Try2Wheels events offer expert advice on everything from route planning to buying a new bike.
The City also offers courses, cycling in the city and bike care and maintenance at the Sydney Park Cycling Centre.
Dockless bike sharing is now in Sydney and provides a low-cost transport option for residents and visitors. 



Sydney Cycleways
We’ve brought together a whole range of information to get you pedalling around Sydney. Visit Sydney Cycleways for:

tips for riding safely
advice for new riders
maps and routes
bike stores and hire
bicycle user groups
upcoming events
cycling and bike maintenance courses
current and completed cycleways.



Beat the traffic.
Fed-up with crowded buses? Join these Sydneysiders and ride instead. Watch the video and share their experience.

Bike sharing




 What is bike share?





Guidelines for bike share operators
Bike share schemes have a key role to play in our transport future.
Dockless bike share is a new business model that allows people to access a fleet of bikes through a smartphone app. Bikes can be used for return or 1-way trips and don't have to be returned to a docking station.
Inner Sydney bike share guidelines 
In December 2017, 6 Sydney councils devised the Inner Sydney bike share guidelines. These guidelines set out expectations for dockless bike share operators.
They were devised by Canada Bay, the City of Sydney, Inner West, Randwick, Waverley and Woollahra councils with bike share operators and other stakeholders.
Download the guidelines below.
Customer safety and conduct
Operators should inform their customers about correct bike parking and responsible riding.
All operators and their customers must obey NSW road rules and consider the safety and comfort of other people on the road and footpaths.
Safe bike placement
Bikes shouldn’t be placed on footpaths that are too narrow or busy, or where they could pose a safety hazard. They should be placed kerbside away from the building. Shared bikes can be placed near public bike racks but rack space should be left free for regular bicycles that need to be locked to a fixed point.  
There are more than 2,500 bike parking places in the city.
The City expects bike share operators to seek legal advice ensuring their fleet is safe and complies with laws regarding user behaviour, consumer protection, transport and road safety.


Avoiding clutter

Operators should monitor the location of all bikes daily to avoid clutter and build-up in an area.
Faulty or misplaced bikes
Operators should enable easy reporting of faulty or damaged bikes, or bikes parked in inappropriate locations, through their app, email or phone.
Faulty or damaged bikes should be removed or repaired promptly.
Operators should also have a means to track their bicycles, such as GPS.
A safe and enjoyable user experience
Operators should promote legal and responsible riding when members join and regularly afterwards.
Riders can incur heavy penalties for offences such as not wearing helmets, unauthorised riding on footpaths, reckless riding and riding through red lights. Bicycles must have bells or other warning devices, front and rear lights, and a rear reflector.
Visit Sydney Cycleways for route-finding advice, maps and information about cycling in Sydney.
Bike riders, just like car drivers, should have insurance in case they’re involved in an accident. Riders should check if their household contents insurance includes public liability cover. Membership to groups like Bicycle NSW or Bicycle Network includes public liability and personal accident insurance.
Better transport planning
We encourage operators to share data with government agencies for transport and urban planning.



Guidelines for bike riders
Bike parking
Bike share customers should consider the safety and comfort of all footpath users by parking bikes in a responsible manner. Keep footpaths and building walls clear for people walking or travelling along the street.
Customers are encouraged to park bikes near bike racks but not to take up space for regular bikes that need to be locked to a fixed point.
Riders can request bike parking on City land.
Shared bikes can be moved out of the way if causing obstruction or you can contact the relevant operator.
If a bike share bicycle is causing a serious hazard, contact the City.
Responsible riding
Riders should obey NSW road rules at all times. NSW Police enforces the road rules and can issue penalties for offences.
Contact the Police Assistance Line on 131 444 for more information.


Bike share enquiries
The City doesn’t manage bike sharing. They are commercial operations.
Contact the bike share companies directly with any enquiries.
Mobike1800 861 201support.au@mobike.com
Lime (e-bikes)1800 861 305support@li.me
If you see a damaged Ofo, oBike or ReddyGo share bike please report it as illegal dumping.

						Free bike tune-ups: Surry Hills
					

						Produced by the City of Sydney
					





 Share
							


 Tweet
							









We’re out and about on shared paths and cycleways in inner Sydney twice a week.
We’re talking to pedestrians and riders about respecting each other’s journey and sharing spaces with courtesy and grace.
Our tune-ups are free and offered on a first come first served basis. Occasionally we will close the queue early to ensure those waiting receive a tune-up before the event finishes at 5:30pm.

Many people associate cycling in Sydney with dodging cars, battling road rage and navigating their way through complicated tangles of main roads and side streets. But there are oodles of dedicated (and more serene) bike paths to explore, passing through expansive parks, around tranquil lagoons and alongside stunning beaches. It doesn't matter if you're still on your training wheels or prepping for the Tour de France, you can still enjoy at least a few of Sydney's best bike rides.

Martin7d2 via Flickr
FOR WATERFRONT: THE BAY RUN
This seven-kilometre path, shared between cyclists and pedestrians, follows the shores of Iron Cove. It travels through nine parks, covers Lilyfield, Drummoyne and Rodd Point, and is never more than 20 metres from the waterfront. Cyclists are treated to excellent views of the bay, in the middle of which lies Rodd Island, Australia's first public recreation reserve and one-time science centre. The ride is a loop, so you can finish up wherever you begin.

Destination NSW
FOR WILDERNESS: NARROW NECK, KATOOMBA
This heady, energising trail follows Narrow Neck Peninsula, right near Katoomba, for nine kilometres each way. The views are outrageously good. And, at one point, the land seems to disappear on either side, leaving you feeling as though you're floating. The landscape includes open forest, heath, swamplands and an abundance of wildflowers. Extend your ride by starting at Katoomba Station.

Destination NSW
FOR LEISURELY WATERFRONT VIBES: MANLY BEACH
This is a good one for those not comfortable riding on the road or navigating any hills, but still wanting to feel the wind in their hair. Start at the north end of the beach at Manly lagoon and make your way south to finish up at Shelly Beach (and maybe a coffee at The Boathouse). If you don't live on the north shore, you can easily take your bike on the ferry.

NSW National Parks
FOR LYREBIRDS AND ECHIDNAS: LADY CARRINGTON DRIVE, ROYAL NATIONAL PARK
To make a proper escape from the city, head to Lady Carrington Drive in the Royal National Park. This 10-kilometre track starts at Audley in the north and follows the Hacking River upstream, ending at Sir Bertram Stevens Drive in the south. In the late 19th century it functioned as a carriage route, but these days is only open to walkers and cyclists. Watch for lyrebirds, lace monitors and echidnas, and leave time for a picnic at one of three dedicated areas. Stop at Palona Brook for a detour to a nearby cave.

FOR TREES: CENTENNIAL PARK
Cycling doesn't get easier than this. The 3.8-kilometre 'Grand Drive' that encircles Centennial Park is flat, car-free and surrounded by greenery. That's why two-wheelers have been coming here in droves since 1900. These days, they number more than 750,000 per year. If you've never ridden before, wobble your way along the dedicated 'learners cycleway', where generations of Sydney's kids have pedalled for the first time. All kinds of bicycles are available for hire, including Fred Flinstone-style pedal cars, which can carry two to four people at once.

sv1ambo vi Flickr
FOR HISTORY: PARRAMATTA HERITAGE TRAIL
Add a dose of history to your workout with a cruise along the Parramatta Heritage Trail. It's an easy-to-ride loop, starting right near Parramatta Station and taking you past some of Australia's oldest buildings, including Elizabeth Farm (built in 1793) and Old Government House (built in 1799). You'll also venture into beautiful Parramatta Park and along the tranquil Parramatta River.

FOR TRANQUILITY: COOKS RIVER
The epic Cooks River cycling route is one of Sydney's oldest and most popular shared paths. Its 23 kilometres start at Settlers Park in Ryde, meander through Gough Whitlam Park and finish at peaceful Botany Bay, following the gorgeous Cooks River most of the way. Various town centres, railway stations and parks are en route, so you can make a day of it, stopping for coffee, lunch and snacks as you go.


FOR ART AND SHIPWRECKS: OLYMPIC PARK
Whether you're a newbie or a BMX king, Olympic Park has something for you. There are 35 kilometres of safe cycle paths, passing shipwrecks, outdoor art installations, lookouts, mangrove swamps and wildlife refuges. Three official bike safaris offer rides to match your ability and interests, including the 7.6-kilometre Olympic Circuit, the 11-kilometre River Heritage Circuit and the 5.5-kilometre Parklands Circuit.


FOR VIEWS: PROSPECT RESERVOIR AND ORPHAN SCHOOL CREEK
This 29-kilometre, entirely off-road loop soars through several high points, affording cracking views of Greater Western Sydney. There are Instagram opportunities aplenty at Greystanes aqueduct — built in 1888, it's 225 metres long and constructed of 22 arches, each of which span 9.1 metres. If you're out and about on a Saturday, pause at Prairiewood to visit the 600 stalls that make up Fairfield Markets. Meanwhile, on any day of the week, you can stop by Calmsley Hill City Farm for furry cuddles and at Western Sydney Parklands for a picnic.

FOR LAPPING WATER AND SWANS: NARRABEEN LAGOON
The Narrabeen Lagoon Trail was completed in February 2015. It's an 8.4-kilometre adventure that follows the lagoon's shoreline, passing through several wildlife protection areas. Keep an eye and ear out for black swans, powerful owls, diamond pythons and fishing bats. There's an incredible variety of ecosystems both in and out of the water, from shallow seagrass meadows to coastal salt marsh and swamp oak floodplain forest.

Cycling in Sydney

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Jump to navigation
Jump to search

Cycling in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia takes place for recreation, commuting and as a sport. Sydney has a hilly topography and so may require a slightly higher level of fitness from cyclists than flatter cities such as Melbourne and Canberra. Sydney depends heavily on motor vehicles where traffic and public transport operate at capacity. This means that cyclist are often competing with motorists for limited space on busier roads, and for limited government resources for expenditure on road infrastructure.[1]  In its favour, Sydney has a generally mild climate and there are active cycling groups. 
In 2015 the NSW Government enacted legislation[2] that increased fines for many offences that are considered by some[who?] as trivial or even legal in most other countries, such as riding without a helmet. 
Cycling in Australia has, until recently, been a minority interest sport, and hostility on the road is also common. One Danish cyclist, Thomas Andersen, who had cycled around the world for four years, singled out Sydney in 2014 as being the worst city he had visited for cyclists.[3]

Sydney cycling network[edit]
 A bike path in Birrong
Main article: Bike Paths in Sydney
For the most part, cyclists ride on the road with motor vehicles (current regulations only  permit cyclists under 16 years old to ride on the foot path [4]. Historically, bicycle infrastructure was largely constructed in areas for recreational riding or along shared paths such as in parks. Prior to the involvement of Jan Gehl, the City of Sydney created a Bicycle Action Plan in 2007,[5] part of which involved building physically separated cycleways. In May 2009, the first of these, a 200m stretch along King Street in the CBD opened.[6]
Subsequently, longer segregated paths have been built[7] along selected routes through the city. There had been plans to extend these separated routes,[8] however these have largely not gone ahead, and some important  commuter paths, like the College Street bike path, have actually been removed at the insistence of Duncan Gay, the former Minister for Roads, Maritime and Freight (who has openly described himself as "the biggest bike lane sceptic in government[9]) with the support of Mike Baird, the Premier of New South Wales.
Another criticism of Sydney's separated paths is that the traffic lights preference cars over both pedestrians and cyclists.[10]  Not only are cyclists critical of the reported difficulty in triggering a light change, they are also unhappy that priority is afforded to cars by default, in much the same way that pedestrians must push a button before being included in the traffic light sequence.
Coinciding with the City of Sydney's new investment in cycleways, the state of NSW has repeatedly released statewide plans for bicycle infrastructure, including in 2010, BikePlan NSW.[11] The plan is acknowledged by Bicycle NSW, but thought to be underfunded by local bicycle groups.[12] While premier of NSW, Kristina Keneally bicycle commuted 10 km each way from the suburb of Pagewood to the CBD.[13]. The latest plan, Sydney's Cycling Future was published in December 2013[14]

Participation[edit]
The 2016 ABS census recorded that in Sydney as a whole, 0.9% of trips to and from work were completed by cyclists. The 2011 census also recorded 0.9% of trips, a 28% increase on the 2006 census figure of 0.7%.[15]
A breakdown by local government area yields the following results[16]

Planning and government[edit]
Local government[edit]
One of the aims of BikePlan 2007–2017 is increasing total percentage trips in the city from 2% to 5% by 2011.[17]
Aside from building cycleways, City of Sydney has engaged in a publicity campaign,[18] 
subsidised cycling courses,[19] installed parking rings throughout the city[20] and subsidised bicycle parking at City of Sydney events which also fund BIKESydney (the local BUG).[21][22] New development controls have been suggested which, among other things, require increasing bicycle facilities in residential and commercial properties.[23][24] The City of Sydney's '2030 Sustainable Sydney' plan (2008) has a section dedicated to cycling.[25]
Cooperation with other associations is often required. For example, the two bridges leading into the CBD are controlled by the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority (Pyrmont Bridge), and the RMS (Sydney Harbour Bridge). The NSW government, through the RMS, control all traffic lights (including along cycleways), arterial roads and speed limits. Although there are plans to limit major CBD roads to private cars,[26] on-going efforts to make the city more friendly to non-motorised transport are made through agreements with the NSW state government.[27]
Other city councils also have bicycle plans of varying scope, based on funding, local demand, and current facilities. In July 2010, Parramatta City Council installed secure bicycle storage area in their city areas,[28] while proposing to reduce overall funding for cycling facilities.
Often, facilities do not extend across council boundaries. For example, lack of co-operation with Botany Bay City Council (which lacks a corresponding BUG) explains the abrupt end at the south end of the Bourke Road cycleway,[29] despite the proximity to Sydney Airport and another cycleway along the Cooks River.
Many councils maintain detailed information about cycling in their region. Some examples are: 

City of Sydney [30]
Lane Cove Council[31]
North Sydney Council[32]
Willoughby Council[33]
The NSW Department of Premier and Cabinet maintain a list of the councils in the Sydney region.[34]

State government[edit]
Roads & Maritime Services is the state responsible for road infrastructure and safety. Their latest bike plan was produced in December 2013 [35] They provide general cycling information.

Regulations[edit]
See also: Cycling in New South Wales § Regulations
It is not uncommon for bicycles to be allowed thoroughfare where cars are not. These may be labelled "bicycles excepted", "shared zones" etc. Contraflow lanes have been installed on some one-way streets specifically for bicycles.[36] The NSW Roads Regulations states that a person must not ride a bicycle on any part of the Sydney Harbour Bridge other than a cycleway.[37]

Groups[edit]
Bicycle NSW[38] is a member-based association representing bicycle users across New South Wales since 1976 and boasts a membership of 15,000+ members, supporters and subscribers.[39] Launched as the Bicycle Institute of NSW to advocate for the use of bicycles for transport, they continue to advocate for the essential infrastructure and education to improve rider safety, and host a series of events to increase participation and rider experiences. Membership of Bicycle NSW includes personal accident and third party liability insurance when riding and a range of other benefits.[40]
Bike Sydney[41] is a not-for-profit community Bicycle User Group (BUG) organisation established in 2000 to lobby state and local government and has since expanded beyond advocacy and is involved in cycling events and services around Sydney.
Bicycle Network, originally Bicycle Victoria, is one of the largest cycling membership organisations in the world, with 45,000 members in 2015,[42] and opened an office in Sydney in 2014.

BUGs[edit]
Many local Bicycle User Groups (BUGs) operate to assist and advocate for cyclists through an official Affiliation or friendly association with Bicycle NSW. Bicycle NSW and the associated PushOn" Magazine maintains a list of BUGs across NSW. A rides calendar is also available on the PushOn website.[43]

Cooperatives[edit]
Sydney has several community based bicycle cooperatives or organisations. Their activities include repair workshops, bike recycling, training and education.

The Nunnery Community Bike Workshop is in Redfern and helps  working bikes go back into the community.[44]
Bicycle Garden in Alexandria runs weekly workshops and collects bikes for asylum seekers in Sydney [45]
Newtwon Bike Shed runs weekly workshops and collects bikes for asylum seekers in Sydney[46]
Bikes 4 Life  alleviates poverty and social injustice in Australia and overseas by recycling and restoring discarded bikes. Currently operating from Kimbriki Resource Recovery Centre in Terry Hills. [47]
University bike clubs and cycling information[edit]
Sydney University provides information to cyclists on their website[48]
Students at the University of New South Wales have established the UNSW Bike Club.[49] UNSW Bike Club was awarded Arc small club of the year in 2009.[50]
The University of Technology Sydney (UTS) provides information to cyclists online.[51]
Other groups[edit]
The Sydney Bicycle Messenger Association.[52]
Dulwich Hill Bicycle Club, a club for inner west Sydney cyclists.[53]
Bike Bus, a Sydney commuters group.[54]
As interest in cycling grows, increasing numbers of informal interest groups are emerging, such as Sydney Cycle Chic,[55] and Sydney Bicycle Film Festival.[56] Others exist as Facebook groups including I Love Sydney Bike Lanes and Cycleways[57].

Maps and routes[edit]
Main article: Bike Paths in Sydney
Many councils provide cycling maps in paper and downloadable format. The NSW government provides a similar service
Several collaborative mapping services are available, some using Google Maps for their base layer

Cycleway Finder (NSW Government)[58]
Bikely[59]
Open Cycle Map[60]
Bike Yak Sydney Trails[61]
BikeTrail.Blog Sydney Map
Bike riding experiences are published in these magazines. 

Bicycling Australia Magazine [62]
Rides[edit]
Regular[edit]
The Bicycle NSW events page regularly lists upcoming rides from various BUGs.[63]
Critical Mass bike ride is held monthly[64]
Bike Bus is a community-led service to introduce groups of people to ride a set route together, to introduce beginners to a route, or enjoy each other's company.[54]

Internet[edit]
Various BUGs, associations and other groups have active discussion pages, mailing lists and web sites.[74][75] .

Public transport[edit]
Due to Sydney's geography, trains and ferries complement cyclists well. For example, trains can take you to the start of some great cycling rides in Ku Ring Gai Chase National Park, or a ferry across Sydney harbour can shorten a cycling trip by not having to rely on limited bridge crossings.   Ferry wharves are also frequently beyond walking distance from surrounding facilities.

Travelling with a bicycle[edit]
Bicycles are permitted free of charge on Sydney Trains and Sydney Ferries.  Ferry access is subject to availability of space. They are not permitted on Sydney Buses.[76]

Bicycle Storage[edit]
There's a growing number of bike sheds and lockers at train stations, ferry wharves and bus interchanges. [77]

Trains[edit]
Sydney Trains railway stations have an uneven amount of bicycle parking
Those transporting a bicycle on a train will notice that not all stations have ramps or lifts to get to the train platform.[78]
Most city trains do not have specific provision for bicycles, aside from the vestibule area. Intercity trains operating Newcastle, the Blue Mountains and the South Coast frequently have a single hook at the end of the carriage.[79]

Ferries[edit]
Private operators may allow bicycles onboard, sometimes for a fee, but it is worth checking before travelling. Private ferry services include: 

Manly Fast Ferry[80]
Cronulla to Bundeena (surcharge applies for bicycles)
Palm Beach to Central Coast[81]
Light rail[edit]
Bicycles are allowed on the Inner West Light Rail trains subject to availability of space.[82] They were also permitted aboard the former Sydney Monorail.

Services[edit]
Sydney has many cycling focused businesses offering services such as bicycle fitting, frame and custom building, bicycle hire and guided tours.

Facilities[edit]
Parking stations[edit]
The City of Sydney council offers free parking for bicycles at Goulburn Street and Kings Cross car parks[83] There are also a number of bike sheds and lockers in the city.[84]

Velodromes[edit]
Sydney has several velodromes including Dunc Gray Velodrome  (Bankstown), which was part of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. Also Hurstville Oval, Lidcombe Oval,  Merrylands Oval and Tempe.  Many velodromes have been demolished including one at Wiley Park

Criterium Track[edit]
Heffron Park (Maroubra) 2.04 km,[85]
Randwick Botany Cycle Club[86]
Events[edit]
'Super Tuesday'. Sydney participates in this annual count of cyclists on the road held in March, organised by Bicycle Network.
Events are also listed on the Sydney Cyclist events page.[87]
Annual awards[edit]
The 'City of Sydney Business Awards' nominations are sought in June, with winners announced in September. A new category for "Bicycle Business" of the year was created for 2010.

Riders ascend Mt Buffalo
It's been a few years since I've been to Bright, in the Victorian Alps, on the Australia Day weekend for the Audax Alpine Classic.

All right, short-attention-span millennials, you don't have to read any further. Forty-five (45) was the number of other cyclists I saw on this year's 72km December 25 ride.

Sydney bike paths | CNN TravelDestinationsFood & DrinkPlayStayVideoSearchMenu5 best bike paths in SydneyOlivia Demlakian, CNN • Published 12th July 2017FacebookTwitterEmail(CNN) — It's not just Cadel Evans -- the first Australian ever to win the Tour de France cycle race -- who enjoys a bicycle ride around Sydney.A cyclists' movement in recent times has ensured that paths cover the harbor city. Bike paths in Sydney are here to stay. Here are five of the best tracks in town the next time you travel here:1. Centennial ParkBikers are staking their claim to Centennial Park.courtesy of centennial parklands/cnnMore than 700,000 cyclists visit Centennial Park each year. This is not surprising considering the parklands, which include entertainment precincts and recreational areas, span 360 hectares in the center of Sydney.The park is open to cyclists from sunrise to sunset, every day of the year. On any given day, you will likely find a range of cruising speeds around the park pathways -- from learners to professional cyclists.The Grand Drive is a 3,500-meter loop around the park, which includes a flat, dedicated bike path that is separated from the hordes of horse riders in the area.Centennial Park has a learners' cycleway that is set well away from the road. It's located next to a children's playground and barbecue area -- making it perfect for family outings.For anyone without a bike, a hire facility located in the heart of the parklands, Centennial Park Cycles, provides instant two-wheeled solutions.Centennial Park Cycleway, open Monday--Sunday, sunrise to sunset, visitor information counter open seven days on Banksia Way. 2. Harbour Bridge to ANZAC BridgeCyclists have their own dedicated path on the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge.patrick riviere/getty imagesThe Kent Street Cycleway runs in between the city's two most iconic bridges.This 2,600-meter route takes riders over two of Sydney's most recognizable landmarks -- the Sydney Harbour Bridge and ANZAC Bridge.This is a relatively easy ride that is protected from the intimidating traffic. It starts at the foot of the Harbour Bridge on the north shore. After a ride over the harbor, the path links directly to the Kent Street cycleway. From there riders join the busy Western Distributor and cross the Pyrmont Bridge.The adjoining Union Street cycleway ends at Union Square -- Pyrmont's heritage town center. Riders then head west to be connected to the final stretch -- the city's largest suspension bridge, ANZAC Bridge.For the leisurely riders who are keen to stop and take in the view, be wary of cyclists heading into the city center during peak hours. Cars aren't the only ones in a rush.3. Birkenhead Point to RozelleEither cycle or jog -- the choice is yours.Cameron Spencer/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty ImagesThe Bay Run has long been a favorite of fitness fanatics jogging along the inner west's harbor foreshore. The seven-kilometer path that stretches from Birkenhead Point to Rozelle also has a cycleway. This perimeter of Iron Cove takes in the UTS-Drummoyne Rowing Club and rowers use the picturesque bay in the mornings.The Bay Run passes through various parks and green spaces, which provides rest stops, as well as fitness stations.4. Narrabean Lagoon Multi-use TrailThis seven-kilometer trail is around Narrabeen Lagoon -- a popular recreation spot on Sydney's northern beaches that welcomes more than 1,000 visitors a day.A further 2,500 meters is currently being added to the track. It will ultimately enable riders to circumnavigate the entire lagoon.Related contentWorld's best cycling citiesThe first stage of the project was recently awarded the state planning department's Sydney Greenspace Award.It is not difficult to see why the environment and green space is of importance -- the lagoon and its foreshore is a natural wildlife corridor. As you ride around this bike track you are exposed to a plethora of native Australian flora and fauna.5. Sydney Olympic ParkThe former swamplands around Sydney Olympic Park are now a popular bike path.cameron spencer/getty imagesSydney Olympic Park is 25 minutes' drive west of the city center in Homebush and has more than 35 kilometers of safe cycleways.Riders have the option of three set circuits that vary in difficulty and in distance from 5,500 meters to 12 kilometers. Plus there's a dedicated bike path for kiddies in Bicentennial Park.Bikers are also given their chance to create their own Cycle Safari -- carving a path through Sydney Olympic Park's dedicated cycleways. Cyclists bring their own bike or hire one from a selection of mountain, cruiser and children's bikes.All bike paths are located close to amenities, including playgrounds, picnic areas, water fountains and bathrooms. So you can easily spend the whole day riding around.Editor's note: This article was previously published in 2011.

Overview
This page shows the mapping strategy for cycle routes in Sydney, NSW, Australia. 
Local cycle routes are documented by local government area below. Most council routes do not have references.  Include them if they are an officially designated reference.
As with all of OSM, please try and map the ground truth, and remember that what you map will be used by visiting cyclists and on many various sites for route planning.  Amateur lawyering as to what you believe may be a "legal" cycle route, is not as helpful as the surveying where the route naturally flows. 

What makes a cycle route in Sydney?
It can be difficult to determine what constitutes a cycle route in Sydney.  Many of the routes are documented on this page so some agreement and consistency can be maintained.  Please try and survey a route when you can.  Many revisions of maps indicate good intentions that were never constructed.  Please add a source or list your cycle route here.  Routes added with no apparent source or reasoning may be revised/deleted by other mappers.
Some of the below factors should be taken into account if deciding if a route is a cycle route:

The route is a connected series of roads and cycleways:
and is indicated relatively continuously on the route by:
new or old Ausroads compliant destination way-marking signs, ie finger signs, decision point signs, reassurance signs.
by blue cycle signs.
by bicycle stencils obviously intended as way-finding aids (reassurance, with directional arrows, continuity, visibility).
by other way-finding aids, such as the Greenway, RMS detours (M4 Detour), non-standard finger signs which are tourist in nature, Cooks River exits, etc.
A long distance actually useful for cycling road shoulder along an express way (Southern Cross Drive, Eastlakes), or a piece of continuous infrastructure alongside a named road Gardners Road Rosebery southern boundary shared path.
or is indicated as a route, not just as infrastructure, on the council or RMS website.
However, also consider the following that may be counter-indicative:

Council routes that are only planned routes should not be mapped. If there is no sign or stencil on the route, and no cycle facilities on the ground, then it may only be a planned route.
Signs and stencils may be discontinuous and not form a route.  Stencils may only indicate infrastructure (shared lane, door zone shoulder, advised shoulder, paired with a Bicycle Lane sign).
Cycle routes in government cycle plans (such as BikePlan 2010) that were never implemented should not be mapped.
A route that is impassible, or that has no destination.
A personal opinion of a 'good way to cycle'.  If you think an unmarked route is a good cycle route, then map the elements that make it one, so that a good cycle router will choose it.  A service like MapMyRide allows you to map personal routes against an OSM map.
City of Sydney cycle routes have implementing the finger sign standards in a comprehensive resignage, so it's easier now to determine a route by survey.  In other council areas it may be more difficult.
The habit of councils in Sydney and RMS have been with destination way finding signs to not supply sufficient reassurance signs on on road routes, or at apparent decision points.  When searching for routes, or following routes, follow the last directed road or street by its apparent "intention," if you can.
Another Sydney/NSW specific problem with naming or providing references for routes is that destination based signage is inconsistent and changes names for the intermediate destinations, or rarely puts the terminal destination on a sign.  Forward and backward relations on the same route will have different destinations sign posted.  Even in the same direction one sign may read "Surry Hills, Gladesville" then "Redfern, Newtown" and the next "Newtown, Gladesville."  No good solution exists yet.

Tagging
If the route is a connected series of roads or paths that leads somewhere, where possible create a relation and add all the ways to the relation. Nodes for guidepost signs may be added as with the tag on the node information=guidepost.  If possible add the route to the tables below. 
Tag the relation:

type=route
route=bicycle
network=lcn or rcn
ref=(No consensus exists regarding references)
name=(Official name if possible, or well known name if not)
source=
Good tags for the relation:

operator= council, RMS, private land owning body (eg: University of Sydney)
phone= for complaints
email= for complaints
website= for complaints
Optional tags for the relation:

symbol= blue bicycle sign ; white bicycle stencil ; destination wayfinding ; B83 ; Gardners Road
note=
roundtrip=yes/no (yes for The Bay Run, no for Cooks River Cycleway)
(per way or node in the relation): role=forward / backward / guidepost / destination / link (for exits)
If the route is discontinuous. or leads nowhere, add the tags to the way.

Local routes with a number: lcn_ref=xx
Local routes without a number: lcn=yes
Regional routes with a number: rcn_ref=xx
Regional routes without a number: rcn=yes
source:lcn / source:rcn=Please indicate the source you used so other mappers can follow-up and link up discontinuous routes
Try to give a sensible name to the way.  A cycleway that has no given name that follows a road can be give the same name as the road.

See Cycle routes for the full tagging guide.

Local Routes
Local Government Areas:

Ashfield
Ashfield Municipality Relation: 1221172 1221172
Ashfield has a number of cycle routes that connect in places to the routes of Marrickville, Burwood and Canterbury Bankstown councils. Ashfield publishes a map. Mapping completion is 100%.

Botany Bay
Map Link
Botany Bay council does not seem to publish a cycling map, although there are a number of marked routes.
Well formed routes from  Sydney Airport and Alexandra Canal Alexandra Canal to the city and the eastern suburbs pass through Botany Bay council.  The routes are well marked at either end of the Botany Bay Council area, but dissolve into a mass of poorly defined routes through the council area.

Burwood
Burwood Municipality Relation: 2161967 2161967
Burwood has a number of routes, although some are still under construction (June 2011). Burwood publishes a map. Mapping completion is estimated to be about 80%.

Canada Bay
Map Link
Canada Bay has a mix of signposted routes and cycle lanes. A council map dated 2010 lists a number of proposed routes. In OSM only actual routes are marked. Mapping completion is estimated to be about 60%.
Canada Bay includes the northern part of the track around Iron Cove, and connecting links from Homebush Bay to the Parramatta River cycleway.

Canterbury Bankstown
Canterbury City Relation: 2162244 2162244
Canterbury cycle routes tend to be reasonably well signposted, and Canterbury Council publishes a cycle map. The M5 Motorway cycleway (see below for regional routes) runs partly through Canterbury. Routes don't have numbers, but some are listed individually. Mapping completion is estimated to be about 60%.

Cyclists can cross Bexley Road at the lights where cars cannot. The part of this cycleway in Hughes Park is closed until mid-2012, and has been marked access=no
106224 106224 [2]


Georges River Council
Map Link
Georges River Council consists of the old Hurstville,  Rockdale and Kogarah council and adjoins Canterbury Bankstown council. Hurstville publishes a map of what they call on and off road cycle paths.  They are generally signposted with dark blue bicycle signs, and occasionally with council themed green bicycle directional signs.  In the centre of the Hurstville CBD (e.g. Forest Rd, The Avenue and Park Road south of Queens Road) there is no signage.  Many of the on road cycle routes run along busy sections of road - like Forest Road.  
Mapping completion is estimated to be 100%.

Inner West Council
Marrickville Municipality Relation: 1230104 1230104
Relation coverage here represents the post-redaction state. Some routes without references are still to be verified.
Marrickville routes historically have been given Lxx numbers.  Some of these signs can still be seen in the area, but they aren't referenced on the council website, and there are now entire routes without a single one of these signs on them.
Routes are generally signposted, but often some intersections are missed.  Mapping completion is estimated to be about 80%. Some historical Marrickville Council planning documents reference previous NSW RMS route numbers, although signs on the ground don't show these.

City of Sydney
Map Link showing extent
City of Sydney is developing an extensive cycle network.  On the ground there is extensive use of blue bicycle cycle signs directing to suburbs considered to be a focus for cycling.  These signs are easy to follow within the CoS area, but often disappear when leaving the CoS area make it difficult to track the assigned routes (for example signs at Sydney Park direct to "Hurstville" and at Newtown to "Gladesville".
CoS provides a Melways basemap covered in nominal routes.  The Sydney Cycleways site also provides some named routes, some directional routes, and some suggested recreational rides.

Regional Sydney Routes
The NSW RMS refers to regional cycle routes in various planning documents, as do local councils. Some local councils reference RMS routes on their web site (particularly in relation building works for new routes), although naming varies from council to council, and reference numbers are generally not signposted.
There are other well known routes (including rail trails) that are more than local that are tagged as regional. These are included here as well.

Outside of Sydney
Hunter and Central Coast councils
Overall: there is excellent network interfaces between regional Maitland and Newcastle routes, with poorer interfaces between Newcastle and Lake Macquarie routes. 

Regional routes:
Greta to Newcastle City via Maitland (New England Highway).
Coastal Cycleway: Newcastle City to Belmont via Fernleigh track.
Newcastle has excellent documents describing cycle routes that generally follow functional road routes or constant infrastructure, with few decision points, and logical arrangements.  Newcastle's route system is a mesh with multiple interconnections between useful routes, and with routes linking to neighbouring council infrastructure.  Newcastle has proceeded to route signposting of some routes.  Newcastle also clearly differentiates Local routes (L#) from Regional routes (R#).  Newcastle also implements a "scenic" route system whose behaviour has been mapped as lcn prior to the redaction.  All regional routes were mapped prior to redaction.  Major local routes (through routes) were mapped prior to redaction.  One scenic route was mapped in full prior to redaction.  It appears as though route mapping will improve here shortly.
Maitland has a poor quality pamphlet describing logical cycle routes that generally follow indirectly arranged and periodic infrastructure.  Major routes are poorly route marked, but follow logical routes along roads that describe the route.  Maitland's route system is concentrated as a star on Maitland, but meshes well with major outbound routes.
Lake Macquarie has poor quality advertising material that describes the presence of infrastructure.  These infrastructures are named and numbered on map, occasionally starting to form a mesh or network.
Other Hunter councils do not appear to provide route networks at this time, and provide infrastructure based programmes.  Some councils conduct demand analyses of desirable routing, but this doesn't result in mapped or signed routes.
Illawarra region councils
Coastal cycleway was mapped, but incompletely route mapped.  Illawarra councils and stakeholders have excellent planning documents regarding this route, but south of Wollongong riding the terrain may be required.
Coastline cycleway
Mapped as ncn
Coastline cycleway was a NSW project providing funding to councils primarily used by councils to produce shared paths in leisure areas.  In Newcastle and the Illawarra funding is being used to produce coherent shared path routes useful for long distance commuting.  In both cases these routes are signposted and marked with varying degrees of success.  They are mapped by councils.  Mapping of the Newcastle and Illawarra sections of Coastline cycleway has been completed.

Major highways with improved shoulders, and major highway forced diversions
RMS states that improved shoulders on motorways permit cycling unless signposted to the contrary.  These infrastructures can follow large long distance routes, and have occasionally been mapped as cycle routes where appropriate on-the-ground signage or facilities indicate.  It is unlikely that these constitute a "national cycle network".
B83 Old Pacific Highway Between Berowa and Gosford cyclists are obliged to use the Old Pacific Highway.  
M1 North of Gosford to Newcastle
M31 Hume and Federal Highways between Goulburn and Canberra/

Tom SmithUpdated: 6 October 2017 Save to wishlistSave to Wishlist Sydney isn’t short on spectacular scenery and its collection of cycleways is no exception, with bike tracks criss-crossing the city and surrounds to provide stunning views for cyclists of all abilities. Get on your bike along one of these six awesome trails in and round Sydney.The Bridge to BridgeSlice through the city on this 6.4km path linking Sydney’s two most iconic bridges, the Harbour Bridge to the north and the Anzac Bridge to the west. Take advantage of the dedicated cycleway across the Harbour Bridge before joining the Kent St cycleway beginning at the foot of the Sydney Observatory, one of the best vantage points on the harbour. Bike lanes shield cyclists from traffic over the Pyrmont Bridge and then the Anzac Bridge, which enjoys lofty views over Johnstons Bay.Anzac Bridge© Richard Taylor _ Wikimedia CommonsThe Bay RunIgnore the name — the Bay Run’s not just for fitness freaks desperate to pound the pavement on foot. There’s also a 7km flat-as-a-tack cycleway curling around the waterfront, connecting Rozelle, Lilyfield, Drummoyne and Birkenhead Point in Sydney’s inner-west. Sandwiched between parklands on one side and the serene Iron Cove on the other, this leafy loop never strays more than 20m from the water.Bay Run Rozelle© Smegs07/Wikimedia CommonsCentennial ParkCyclists have been flocking to Centennial Park in the heart of the city since it first established bike paths in 1900, and the 360 hectares of urban greenery are as popular with pedallers as ever. The 3.5km Grand Drive loops the perimeter of the park while kids will love the Learners Cycleway, which includes a playground. Centennial Park’s open 365 days a year from dawn till dusk and you can hire bikes and even your own four-seater pedal car with enough room for the whole family.Centennial Park Sydney© J Bar/Wikimedia CommonsSydney Olympic ParkSports nuts can cycle the sights that made up the glittering Sydney 2000 Olympic Games at the sprawling Olympic Park in Homebush, half an hour south-west of the city. More than 35km of cycleways are split into three main circuits — the 11km River Heritage Circuit through the woodlands, the 7.6km Olympic Circuit taking in all the big sporting venues, and the 5.5km Parklands Circuit through the mangroves.Sydney Olympic Stadium© Adam JWC/Wikimedia CommonsLady Carrington DriveSydney’s historic Royal National Park — a must-visit in its own right, an hour’s drive south of the city centre — can be appreciated up close and personal on this 10km riverside route shaded by towering gum trees; which passes by creeks, rainforests, and picnic areas to break up the journey. Serious cyclists can also tackle the 70km Royal National Park Loop that really gives you an appreciation of the vast scale of this epic nature reserve.Royal National Park© ShutterstockNarrabeen LagoonOne of the Northern Beaches’ favourite recreation spots features a recently completed 8.4km nature trail connecting four picnic grounds dotted around the tranquil Narrabeen Lagoon.
